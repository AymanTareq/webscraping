Marsha S. Auster,leaky batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not only did a few batteries leak they ruined one of my Gideon Flameless LED candles. I am so disappointed. I thought that with the Amazon name I would have a quality product. I purchase many products from the Amazon website.I would like a refund and a replacement for the ruined Gideion Flameless LED candle. I purchased three candles and the 6 inch candle is ruined.
B. Bourque,These batteries leak and will destroy electronic devices.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually love Amazon products, but hate these batteries. A pack of 36 AAA were purchased in 2015 and used in a number of items, ranging from clocks, multi-meters, IR temperature gauges, etc. Every single one of these devices that I have placed the Amazon batteries in, and left them for a couple years, has leaked causing serious damage to the product. Duracell and Energizer batteries have never leaked on me. Spend more money and get a quality battery that will not leak. Amazon should not be selling such a poor product that has caused many times the batteries original purchase price to my electronic devices."
D. Ross,Leaked and ruined a vehicle alarm remote control!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately these batteries are not a quality product. I purchased a carton of them with expiration dates of 2027 yet they go dead quickly and LEAK! The only reason I tried this brand is due to many Duracell failures over the past couple of years including longevity and leakage. It seems to be a constant battle these days finding a decent battery at any price point and I'll assure you that THESE are NOT a decent battery. So now what? Well, I attempt to locate each piece of equipment into which these leakers were installed and replace them with a different brand. Not to mention I'll need to toss the remaining ""good"" (and I use that term loosely) batteries."
Westin S,Battery case ruptured!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Well I would have thought these batteries were great up until I opened my kids RC spider and found one of the batteries had ruptured. Don't think I've ever seen the case of a battery come apart like this. Ordered AC Delcos this time around. Some other reviewer posted performance data indicating they were the best bang for your buck. Had no problems prior to this one so I can't say it's a systemic issue but it is worthy of note.
T. Smiley,Something's Wrong!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a new Amazon Firestick remote control (sweet puppy consumed the previous one). Had it for a couple of weeks and received an alert that the battery life was low and so I bought these Amazon batteries as a replacement. (I love Amazon, right!?) Received the batteries and changed them in the remote. Four days later the alert pops up on the TV that battery life was low again. Busy and consumed with teaching summer school and raising children, I thought maybe I just ""thought"" about replacing them before but didn't really do it. So I did do it (again) and sure enough, within 4-5 days the same alert appears. Replaced the batteries again in the remote. Last night, the same alert appears. ... Unbelievable! What is wrong with these batteries? At this rate of having to replace these batteries, I can't afford to watch free TV. I'll never buy these batteries again."
Michelle,Do not buy! Barely last or even works.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries for my closet automatic LED light strips that turn on for 30 seconds. I only go Into my closet 4 x a day but I would replace the batteries once a month. Then my Duracell batteries in my Thermostat died after five years. I replaced the Thermostst with Amazon batteries, would not turn on. I went through half the pack and finally one pair of Amazon batteries worked! Next day? Thermostat indicated low batteries and the screen barely can be read. Replaced the batteries in my thermostat with Enigizer batteries, no issues!"
jan bush,Don't waste your money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these batteries to go in some led puck lights. Each light takes 3 batteries. I purchased them about 2 weeks ago and installed the lights. This morning the lights were already out, and I had to replace the batteries again. These lights are not in constant use, I'd say only used approximately 4 or 5 hours in the 2 weeks I've had them. The batteries are CRAP, and prove the adage, you get what you pay for."
D. Campisi,"Considering the price as well as performance, I can't find a better deal on batteries",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been buying Duracell batteries (AA, AAA, C, D) from Sam's Wholesale club because the bulk prices were better than small battery packages, but I switched to AmazonBasics. The reason is the price. Of course, that brings up the question of performance. Which is better? I have 3 kids and a zillion electronic toys. We replace batteries often around here, and frankly there are so many electronic toys, controllers, and remotes, that I have a hard time keeping up with performance of specific batteries. But I came to a realization after comparing prices between the 48 pack of AmazonBasics, and the 48-pack of Duracell at Sam's. For the batteries I was buying, the Duracells would have to last 66% longer to justify the price difference. Now I can't be sure which lasted longer, but I know for sure the Duracells I used to use were NOT lasting 66% longer than the AmazonBasics. They may have been better, but not THAT MUCH better. I'll stick with the AmazonBasics."
LMW,Buyer beware! Not safe!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I added 4 of the batteries to my charger (also purchased from Amazon) and heard a popping noise in the middle of the night. Discovered the AAA batteries were popping or bursting or something. I’ve used this charger before with other Amazon batteries, but never the orange colored ones. Not sure what’s different with the orange batteries but I will never purchase these again. Hoping my charger will still work."
Damon S.,Complete Garbage!  You get what you pay for...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are complete garbage. I have all sorts of dead batteries and some have exploded in my electronics and gadgets. It's that or they die very quickly. Which means there must be other dead cells in batteries that are in the chain. What people don't realize is, batteries work in a series. So when one battery dies, it works as a pass through after that which puts a greater strain on the rest of the batteries in the chain which can cause them to heat, swell or explode. You get what you pay for. I will not be buying anymore of these second class batteries. Energizer and Duracell cost what they do for a reason."
PCMR,"If you like paying for 36, but only getting 24 batteries then THIS is the product for you",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Box was open and only 24 batteries were in it. Not going to return as it’s not worth my time, but someone should know."
O. Albretsen,Work just fine and GREAT price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reading reviews here from people complaining about these batteries is pretty comical. The funniest thing was the amazing number of people crying and giving low score reviews because their batteries won't ""charge up right.""Wow, people today don't even understand the CONCEPT of disposable batteries, lol! For me, these are working just great. I bought a 20 pack for $7, which is about what 6 Duracells normally cost, so, value-wise, they'd have to be REALLY bad to make them a poor purchase. I've used about 8 of them in various electronic devices for a couple months now, and have had no leaking or weak power issues anywhere, so 20 solid AAA batteries for just $7 is a GREAT DEAL!I can't accurately speak about longevity after just a couple months, but everything else about this purchase is very satisfying.Update: it has now been 9 months since I bought these batteries, and have yet to encounter any negative issues (such as leaking or low power). I only use them in things that won't use much charge, such as remote controls. Thus far, I haven't had any of them run out of power."
Bec_O,LEAK LEAK LEAK,1.0 out of 5 stars,"LEAKS GALORE! If one of your favorite things in life is to have your batteries leak in expensive toys and ruin the electrical components of said toys, these batteries are for you. These leaks occurred in toys that are used almost daily, so the batteries weren’t just sitting around unused. We even had a few batteries have the end cap come off of the - end. Fanfreakingtastic. This happened with both AA and AAA batteries and multiple batteries experienced the leaking. Saving a few bucks on Amazon branded batteries isn’t worth it compared to the value of the toys that were ruined."
Jamie,Battery life is very short.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries specifically for these lights that I turn on using the remote in photos privided for about 3 hours each evening. I have 5 lights. I put the amazon batteries in 3 and a name brand batteries in the remaining 2 lights. The amazon batteries are already dead and had to be replaced, whereas the name brand batteries are running strong. Very disappointed in the quality of the amazon basic aaa batteries."
Schpeen,"Great Value, and Good batteries.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit skeptical to buy a non brand name battery but we go through so many batteries in my house I decided to give these a try. I have several friends and family that have purchased these and add good luck so I went ahead and bought them. Pretty impressed for the amount you get for the price, and they are performing just as good as name brand batteries I have gotten for years. I will now continue to get these for all sizes. Save your money, and get these."
Patrick Montoya,Great price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Last long
HY,Awful. Only 25 pct (indicator says so) using new batteries.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are ridiculously overrated. I decided to give Amazon batteries another try after a bad experience the first time but I thought the price was right again. Shame on me. I ordered 48 batteries. I use them for automatic candles. I do not use them all at once and so when I tried to use a brand new package for a timer, the battery indicator kept flashing and it showed at about 25%. I opened another package of four out of this box, tried another brand new two batteries and the same thing happened. These might be great if you use them right away but if you hold onto them for a couple of months and try to use them later they are worthless. Beware and just go with Energizer or Duracell. This is a Complete total waste of money. Shame on Amazon. Of course it is too late for me to get any sort of refund so I have about 24 batteries that are only at 25%."
Colin Cameron,Packing by Amazon was Terrible,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like Amazon basics batteries but these came in way to big of a box with no paper or air pouches or anything to keep them from flying around inside and the actual box of batteries broke open to packs of batteries all over the shipping box.
D Beans,The Bunny Battery vs the Amazon AAA Battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the prices of the Amazon brand batteries and decided to test them against the Energizer brand battery. I have two identical ThermoPro TP65A Indoor Outdoor Thermometer base units connected to three outdoor remote sensor units. I replaced the two AAA batteries in each unit at the same time, one with Energizer brand and the other with Amazon brand (gray) batteries. The units are in my kitchen on the side of the refrigerator, I see them every day. After 70 days I noticed the display on both units was not working. The unit with Energizer batteries faintly displayed only the lower indoor reading, and the unit with the Amazon batteries had a blank display. I tested the batteries with a ZTS Pulse Load Multi-Battery Tester. The Energizer batteries registered 20% power remaining, the Amazon batteries 10%. Neither battery had enough power remaining to power the display. Both displays quit working within 24 hours of each other. At half the price I consider the Amazon brand batteries a great value."
cocokru,Amazon AAA batteries,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They seem to work okay except a few fell apart. Out of 10 used ina toy 1 (left in pic) started unraveling, 1 lost some of its color (middle) and the other 8 are fine (example to the right). I’ve had batteries corrode before but never fall apart or change color so not sure if it’s okay or not but it sure makes me skeptical and I probably wouldn’t purchase again."
Bee,Solid little batteries.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It could be my imagination, but I feel like I go through less batteries with these than the brand name. I have noise canceling headphones I wear multiple times daily (working and walking to work), so I go through a lot of AAA batteries. However, since I switched to these I don't seem to! Or they just give me so many so cheaply I don't notice as much. Either way. Good buy!"
watches the sky,Horrible life span!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my BP twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I've also used them in my air conditioner remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Alexa/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. This is the first Amazon labeled/made product that I have bought that was not rated a 5. Don't buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery."
wood,Most are dead or have little charge,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these in October 2017 and now in January 2018 I put them in a device and it didn't work at all. These were brand new out of the pack and there is zero charge in the battery. Of course it's now too late to return them. I would not buy these again. The come in shrink wrapped packs of four batteries. I opened four different packs and they are all dead.
Don Dudley,"Basic Battery, Basically Good",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have a lot of things in our house, that for some reason, require triple A batteries. We have clocks, remotes, thermometers, keyboards, and more that need these. We got poor performance from rechargeable batteries in a lot of these devices so I elected to go the old fashioned way. The Amazon Basics brand has always seemed to do well and their AAA batteries are the same. They last a decent amount of time. Case in point, my son's bluetooth keyboard only got about a month out of the rechargeable batteries. So far he has not even seen a hint of needing to replace these and it has been almost two months (about 1.75 months as of this review). I will probably always look to buy these in the future. Far cheaper than even four batteries at the local grocery store."
Tony S. Dutton,These batteries do not recharge with either my duracell or ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries do not recharge with either my duracell or other charger I've tried. I should say they do not charge the first time. Ended up tossing the whole bunch away. Either I'm doing something wrong or a whole lot of reviewers of this product are a lot luckier than me.OOps! My bad. I just now tried three more new batteries right out of the box and before trying to charge them, I put them directly into the flashlight. It worked perfectly, nice and bright. Evidently, I was trying to charge already fully charged batteries and kept getting the blinking red light on the charger. I went back to the trash can and pulled out about ten batteries I thought were defective. Live and learn. I take back all the bad I've said about these batteries. Yeah, my bad."
Alloftheabove,Haven’t had one fail yet,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used a lot of different brands of batteries and these have by far the most value when buying batteries regularly. I use them often for camera and audio equipment. I know some people are fans of rechargeable batteries but I’ve found even the more expensive ones to start to lose their capacity after a couple dozen charges. The price of these batteries is such that I’m ok buying brand new ones for each new shoot. I’ll take them out after the shoot and put them aside for remotes, flashlights and other items I’m ok with the battery dying and just heading up to the stash of half charged batteries for more. I do think some brands last longer than these but they are also way more expensive."
Benjamin Hendricks,Very Fast Drain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I often buy Amazon Basic products, and until I tried their batteries I've never had a complaint. But these batteries drain faster than any but the absolute cheapest I've ever used. So no bargain there. You get what you pay for with this, unlike most other Amazon branded items."
Anita F.,Can't beat the price & they last just as long as the more expensive brands.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love to decorate for EVERY Holiday and EVERY Season.The majority of my Decorations either use batteries or need a battery operated candle.As one can imagine, I use ALOT of batteries. Buying the OVER PRICED Name Brand batteries was getting quite costly. I decided to try a store's generic brand. I was surprised that they were almost 1/2 the price yet worked just as long as the Name Brands.I do a lot of shopping on Amazon so I figured I'd give their generic brand a try too. You can NOT beat their price! I saved even more than I did buying the generic from the brick & mortar stores.I just started using them today.I used 24 today alone to light all of my Decorations. I've had them burning for 6hrs now. I have my Decorations set to come on for 6hours each night and then come back on again at the same time the next night. So, I will have them running every night for 6hours. So let's see how well these batteries hold up. I feel like they'll do the job comparible to the Name Brand batteries.UPDATE: Very pleased with the value and quality. These batteries last longer than expected and are dependable. I am a customer for life. P.S. Thank you for saving me money"
Giovanni Nocturna,A really short-lived battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these AAA batteries mostly for use in high intensity flashlights, initially they work as well as other, more expensive batteries - but die a very premature death. While top end batteries last several hours, the AB ones started to dim after 15 - 20 minutes, and in some situations that can be very dangerous. I ended up just throwing out the rest of the package out because it's just not worth the risk of having a failure at the wrong time. 'The sting of poor quality lingers long after the pleasure of low price'"
Susanna White,Batteries die very quickly,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these for a few flawless LED candles that we had around the house for Christmas decor. After seeing the price, I was very excited to get a battery that according to other reviews would be great compared to the price of name brands batteries. A few of my candles took 3 batteries and some took 2, but within a week of installing these they started to die. Now, these candles were on a timer to turn on each day for six hours. That means the life of these batteries wasn't enough to for three of them to power an led candle for more than 42 hours before they started failing. Not worth the money I paid for this product."
Mullanphy Lane,this time I was sold a bill of goods,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a package of AmazonBasics 4-Count AAA High-Performance Alkaline Batteries, 10-Year Shelf Life, Easy to Open Value Pack... because the price was less than brand name batteries. I figured one battery is pretty much the same as another. I was wrong.When the batteries arrived I put two of them in my Sony digital audio recorder because the brand name batteries in had died after nearly a year's use. The two Amazon batteries were completely drained in less than 30 days, during which the recorder was not used at all. The claim is that they have a 3 year shelf life, but they leave out the fact that, once put into use, they last less than a month.I've purchased Amazon Basics products in the past and those products were satisfactory, but this time I was sold a bill of goods."
aly.me,SO good!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came in a cardboard box that holds all the batteries perfectly that is reusable so you can close it easily with all the batteries in it, not like an awkward plastic packaging like most batteries. And when you open that box, they are grouped and plastic wrapped in 4’s which is awesome!! Super easy to use, and close up when done, I’m a fan! Using them in lots of little LED desk lights for crafting, remote controls for fire sticks, and now some Christmas lights and I don’t know if they last the same as other name brands but I feel like they last longer?! I’ve had them in this LED light that I swear would normally have been dead weeks ago! So I will buy these amazon basics batteries from now on!"
Kathy and Vince,Junk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wife, unbeknownst to me, ordered these. Simply put, they suck!! They come “overcharged” , and they die a quick death, with occasional leakage!!!! Poor batteries!!What a shame! Amazon could’ve cornered the battery market too! I thought only a few manufacturers made all the batteries and just labeled them differently. Main takeaway here is : buy established name batteries . Look for 4.5 and up rating. Amazon should have a 4-5 rating scale. A product rated 4 stars can be junk. But 4.7,4.8..... now you’re talking!!! ( as long as there are no fake reviews)"
Reese Dianato,Disappointed after being pleased for several orders.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these before in AAA and AA and they were awesome! Then the last 2 orders I got were terrible. I had hoped that I had just received a bad batch and it was a fluke. Then I got my 2nd and now last order. I don't know how it's possible, but they were worse. I only use these in the little candles that are on a timer and come on for a few hours every night. They are lasting 10-14 days in these. If they are in the ones that cycle through colors, it's about 10 days, if they stay one color it's 14. In remote controls I'm getting about 3 months. Compared to ones purchased at dollar store markets, I was getting longer use from the dollar ones by about double, and using the Rayovac batteries I'm getting about 3 times as long. Don't know what happened to this brand, as I stated, when I first purchased these, they were as good as the higher priced batteries, but 2 times in a row of terrible lasting power isn't a fluke, it's a pattern and money is too tight with this economy right now to be wasting money. If I thought it would be worth it, I'd ask for my money back. But I threw away the batteries since they were dead. Value for money? They're cheap batteries, and you get short life, so I guess that's ""getting what you pay for"". But I removed them from my subscription list because I'd rather spend a few more dollars and have something I know is going to work."
Cowboy,These are like the Holiday Inn Express of batteries.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are decent batteries at a fair price. They do not have the best longevity of all the different AAA batteries that I've tried, but they get the job done and affordable enough that you can still replace them more often and still come out ahead. So let me give you a fair assessment, these are about 4 star batteries in the context of rating them on quality within the price range. These are like the Holiday Inn Express of batteries and not in the same league as a five diamond resort. They are great for remote controls, kids toys, small electronics, etc. I wouldn't use them on any medical or life safety equipment. Just keep in mind that you are ordering a value battery and you get what you pay for."
Shafqatullah Syed,Nice deal but leaked.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I am not giving this a five star rating because every batch had a battery or a few that leaked. It did not hit me at first but as I kept buying them I noticed it happens only with the Amazon batteries. I kept buying them because of the great price per item. I am glad they did not leak in an expensive electronic device. I think I am going with the costier solution for important items and these for my kids cheap toys.
L. Carothers,"Long time user of all batteries,  Amazon is just as good!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Amazon's batteries on and off since they started offering them. They have a great lifespan. The important aspect of a battery for me is that I live in a hurricane possible area. Every couple of years it's time to check the battery supply for all the emergency items. Amazon batteries keep the same lifespan of the name brand batteries.In addition to the hurricane items, the daily use for remotes, everyday flashlights, and various other things, no complaints. Amazon batteries are just as good. IMO.I am a bit of a bargain shopper, so I do get the name brand when they are on a deal of the day, or have a vendor who marks them down. I am confident that I have the knowledge to give a fair assessment of the Amazon batteries."
Mike,Not worth more then 9.99,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have never used or seen such crap batteries. If the price stays at 9.99 for 100 batteries then that would be ok for the quality vs price to go the distance. If your looking for a quality battery at a good price, this will still get the job done, just not as long as say a rayovac or some other off brand battery. If you have electronics that eat batteries do t use these. If you have something that’s dependent on batteries these are not it. Kids toys or something of that nature then these batteries are ok."
Becky,"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received ...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packaging, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packaging as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remotes that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaked, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had corroded inside.I'm not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package? I'll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money"
Donna Loves Reviews,Works just as well as the name brand and lasts longer!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use a lot of batteries in our household so I decided to give the Amazon batteries brand a try and we are all very pleased with how well they work. Before purchasing the Amazon brand we were all using the name brand batteries and it really got pricy with how often they needed to be replaced for all of our electronics. Luckily the brand we always used was out of stock and we needed batteries asap. After looking for an alternative to purchase I came across the Amazon batteries and read all of the reviews. I figured what do I have to lose by trying these even if they don't work out I can always use the as a spare in between purchases of the name brand.These batteries work very well and seem to last much longer than the previous batteries we had used. We use these for keyboards, mouses, remote controls, toys and so much more and they last a long time, which is very impressive. I use a bluetooth keyboard that connects to several devices so I can text and type on my phone and iPad daily and this keyboard lasts weeks before the batteries need to be replaced. That is much longer than the previous batteries. The batteries come in a brown box with the batteries wrapped in plastic. We are all very happy with this brand and will continue to purchase these batters. This is a product that I would recommend to others for sure."
Texas Five,I was very disappointed and will not be buying these again,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These were purchased for a banquet to illuminate lights in our centerpiece vases. I thought these would have had enough juice to get through the evening but more than half of the vases were failing an hour before the event conclusion. I was very disappointed and will not be buying these again. It's unfortunate that they are listed as ""performance"" batteries vs. some other descriptive name. I should have read the critical reviews more carefully and noted that these don't have as much power per cell as Rayovac or others. Strangely, we used very cheap no-name batteries last year for the same event that lasted the entire evening and then some. I couldn't remember where they came from so I had to look for substitutes. I thought I was making a good purchase with a trusted brand. Unfortunately, that assumption wasn't accurate."
Lisaico,Amazon's Quality Control is Slipping!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased these batteries before and they are good quality and fairly inexpensive. But Amazon's quality control has got to step up! The battery box was opened from both ends and its contents spilled within the shipping box. No big deal, right. Except when I put all the batteries back in the box there's still space inside. So I decide to count the batteries...and find that an entire pack of 4 was missing! Which means that the busted pack of batteries was shipped to me without even checking to see if everything was there."
Tenchi,Inexpensive and gets the job done,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased these batteries at least 3 times before. It's inexpensive and convenient to have when everything these days requires AAA batteries. Thankfully, I haven't dealt with any leaky batteries. I'll update this review if I do.The main reason I'm docking off two stars is because they don't really last that long. These batteries tend to die in less 2 months, even when the battery powered product is not in continuous use."
Ashley Runski,Simply Do Not Believe All The One Star Reviews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use 10 to 15 AA and AAA Amazon batteries each and every month to power a range of professional electrical tools and meters that I must use for my work as a licensed electrician. I have never, repeat, never had the slightest problem with any of the Amazon batteries. I have never had so much as one leak acid or fail to properly fit. As an electrician, the first thing I do before putting any battery in a tool or meter is test its voltage. So far I have never had an Amazon that did not register either very strong or excellent before first use. Think this may be yet another case of folks who can't figure out how to use even the simplest thing giving up in frustration and giving whatever they don't understand a single star. Seems to happen all too often."
Theresa,"Don’t believe the hype, they work fine",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries a while ago and I am now buying a second pack. My child used most of them in his nerf guns without my permission 🤬 however... they are STILL holding up! Those nerf guns EAT batteries like super fast! So that was the real test for me.They didn’t come all nasty and exploded like you see in some reviews here, they were clean, in a cute little cardboard box and shrink wrapped nicely in groups of 4 each. I do remember them being in a large Amazon box for some reason, it was a little weird but what ever, that how they wanna send them over, that’s ok with me, it didn’t bother them at all.I will do another review when I get the second round in. I’m sure they will be fine too. I am pretty surprised to see all these bad reviews! These batteries are disposable, all these people are trying to recharge them and having issues... that’s the problem they are having. For a decent discount batterie, I am very satisfied."
R Teale,Came for the Hurlin'... Stayed for the Performance!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought these Amazon Basics AAA Batteries for hurling at my church choir on early Sunday services (before Pastor Mike shows up, obvs). I sit off to the side and well, this is supposed to be a review of the batteries.I ended up needing a AAA battery to power up my Paw Patrol Walkman so I could crank up some Smash Mouth instead of having to listen to Pastor Mike babble on about Jesus for what feels like an eternity! Like seriously, I have other stuff to do on Sunday, too, dude!Anyway, I threw in a fresh Amazon Basics AAA battery, pressed Rubbles' nose and ""All Star"" never sounded so good! The beauty of meticulously crafted music took me away. It flew me up to the clouds and I hung around with the archangel Gabriel, and we rocked out!Since then I have been using these Amazon Basics AAA Batteries for everything that requires AAA batteries. I mean, I already bought them!Much love,Heather"
Joe,not all batteries are created equal,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I am a big Amazon shopper. Even before Covid, and most the Amazon product are great...but NOT these batteries. Some arrived dead out of the package, not many but a few. The others last literally 50% as long as Duracell or alternatives. I put them in these under the cabinet LED lights in my kitchen. These are low impact LEDS just to add accent lighting. They are only one when you approach them and for 5 minutes. These batteries literally lasted about a month (Each takes 8 batteries) … not good. I reloaded them and put 2 of them with Duracell regular batteries not the long lasting kind. The new Amazon batteries (second batch) died BEFORE the Duracell in the device right next to each other. No difference in demand but performance was literally 50%.These are not good batteries."
Karelia Stetz-Waters,Dead On Arrival Batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Amazon Basics products, and I hope Amazon will see this review and make things right. I kept having trouble with battery powered devices around my house. After a lot of misguided troubleshooting (including requesting a replacement product from another company...I feel bad about that) I realized the problem was that about half my Amazon Basics batteries had no charge.When I went to message the seller, I found it was a lot harder to message Amazon than to message other sellers. When I looked for the Amazon Basics return/warranty policy, it was a long, impenetrable single-spaced document (as opposed to the easy click-to-return on my other purchases).This made me suspicious of Amazon Basics products, and I probably won't any Amazon Basics again...unless the nice folks at Amazon read this and send me a pack of replacement batteries."
Gregory D. Rosenberg,Great value for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been very happy with the AmazonBasics batteries in general. I use AAA, AA, 9v, C, and D batteries. I am hoping that AmazonBasics will start offering high-energy lithium batteries. It would also be good to have a readable expiration date on the batteries. I change 98 batteries twice a year in April and September. The high energy lithium typically have a temperate range of -40F to +140F. Which means they effectively have zero water content and therefore wont freeze in crack in our often brutal Chicago winters."
Melissa Mills,Crappy batteries for sure!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the batteries specifically for my puck light set and I placed them under the kitchen cabinets. Well I had only used them maybe 3 times for 30 minutes each time on a timer with the remote. They had only been installed for about a month. I tried using them a couple days ago and each puck light would not come on! I thought, maybe it's the puck lights because surely these batteries should last longer than 30 days and I had used the lights maybe 3 times already for 30 minutes like I said. So, I changed the batteries in all 4 lights. Now they are all working again. So, the Amazon batteries are pretty crappy and a waste of my money. The new batteries I just installed about a week ago are already starting to get dimmer in the puck lights so they look like they are dying quickly as well again. I will NEVER purchase Amazon batteries again!!?"
J. Basile,Why you should and why you shouldn't!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon strikes again! I cannot explain the love I have for amazon.com. I recommend it to everyone that I meet and I do almost every single one of my purchases through this company.Now to make things even better Amazon has batteries.Why you should:These batteries arrived quickly, they arrived fresh in terms of longevity and have so far worked very well for our purposes. You get an enormous quantity for such a reasonable price that even if some of the batteries were bad on arrival (which I have not found to be the case) I still think it is so worth it.Why you shouldn't:If you hate good deals then stay clear of this product!batteries are amazing and they help you do amazing things. These batteries in particular are absolutely fantastic and worth every penny of your hard-earned money!"
LoriAnnR,Zero longevity,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm stunned at the positive rating these batteries have. They are TERRIBLE! I'm constantly replacing these In my battery operated LED candles. My candles are lit for a few hours daily and I've replaced the batteries 4-5 times already (within 3-weeks). Longevity is aweful...complete waste of money. If there was a way to return them, I would but considering that I only have about 1/2 left, I don't believe that would be possible. I won't be purchasing these again."
Danny E Sieg,"""Best Packs of Batteries I ever Bought!""",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been purchasing various sizes of Batteries since the 1960's and the day's of transistor radios and flashlights. Batteries have always been a constant source to drain my pocket or wallet of cash. I did hesitate a bit at first, after all, being endocrined by that the cute, little ""Energizer Bunny"" banging that cymbal as he kept going and going and going... you know the drill. Then the opposition ""Duracell"" brought claims that quarantined longer lasting staying power or your money back. Pretty tough computing no matter what. Yet, Amazon, has a reputation and warranty for products bearing the ""Amazon"" lable, which is proven, tested and witnessed by me, Danny E. Sieg. The AAA Batteries have been used me for last 3 to 4 years and work as well or better than the other products mentioned. I still have AA Energizer's left from a 10 pack and still purchased two sleeves of AA Amazon batteries, on seperate orders, because I have found them to be better."
D.Woodward,As good as most,4.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are used frequently because of a motion toy one of the cats wants on. They don't last for long periods but when compared to more known brands--they last about the same amount of time. My complaint is that they are wrapped in groups of 4 and have to be opened by scissors and take a while to get the wrap peeled off .I am not anxious to stand there and try to unpeel the wrap.Most all the batteries out there are even harder to get unwrapped except for the ones you can get in a box already unwrapped--and in the AAA size-I have not yet found those.
Randy Edwards,Low Voltage = DOA,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased 36 of the AAA Amazon batteries about 6 months prior. I put 6 new ones in a device (electric pepper mill) and thouight that the device was broken. I tried again 3 months later....checked the batteries in the never used device and they were 1.25 v in all 6 batteries. I thought that there might be a voltage leak in the device, so I put in 6 new batteries (brand new, still wrapped in their cellophane wrappers). The device still would not work. I was ready to thow the mill out, but I thought to check the new batteries that I just installed and they too were all 1.25 v. That voltage (1.25 v) is considered to be a dead battery for AAA alkalines.Amazon owes me and others some sort of restitution. Also, I wouid like to know if they have done anything to change the sourcing of their so-called ""economy "" AAA alkaline batteries.Amazon, get back to me and tell me!!!!!!!!"
Kris,THEY DON'T WORK WHEN THEY ARE COLD,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really wanted to like these batteries, great value and they do work well...INDOORS.Put them in a flashlight which I keep in my Yukon, It's cold here in Portland Oregon ( Nov. 2018 ). Went to use my flashlight the other night and it would not illuminate. Brought the flashlight inside and changed the batteries and it worked fine. The next morning, just for my own piece of mind, I put the previous batteries back in the flashlight and seeing as they had warmed up to room temperature they too worked fine. Put the flashlight back in the Yukon and waited until the temperatures dropped after nightfall and again, no illumination. These batteries are basically worthless for anything other than indoor applications. By the way, Energizer Alkaline batteries work just fine in cold temperatures so I don't want to hear the ""should have bought lithium batteries"" comments."
Muledography,Batteries are Garbage!  They don't last!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to find the low cost of these batteries from Amazon - was very impressed that the per battery price was lower than even Costco Kirkland batteries (which I have been buying for years).... But now that I have been using them, I can see the quality is horrible and the reason they are cheap is because they don't last! :( I have used my Mac with wireless keyboard and mouse for the last 9 years... during that time, I usually have to replace the batteries every few months (4-6 months) under normal usage, maybe 2-3 months if using more than normal. However in both of these accessories since installing the Amazon basics batteries, I have had to replace batteries already twice now in about 6 weeks. This is crazy. Have gone through 4 batteries on each of the accessories (8 total) in the time that I would have gone by just fine with HALF the amount of batteries. Won't buy again!"
Golferguy,FAIL!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a one star review based on my experience with these new AAA batteries. I had been using Amazon AAA batteries for years in an outdoor application for a timer that operates an automatic door opener. These batteries purchased late December 2019 have failed to last more than a few weeks in the same application that they used to last for 1/2 year. They appear somewhat different than the older batteries that they have replaced and I suspect they are sourced from a different manufacturing plant or have modified the chemistry so they no long last in cold applications. If these were to be used for any type of security system or for emergency use outdoors, there function could be seriously impaired. This I believe is my first 1 star review for any Amazon product, these batteries should be discontinued!!!"
jcook,Dangerous corrosion and very little life.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I put these in my 16 electric Christmas candles. None of them lasted the 3x per week, 4hrs at a time use over two months. Worse, of the 45 batteries used, at least 10 corroded. Each of the candles was damaged (that I spent 3 years finding the exact right ones). One corroded so badly that the small spring pushed the end of the battery into the battery. Baffling how this could be an Amazon-branded product."
H. J. Paradis,Not what they used to be,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Up until two Years ago I would only use Energizers and Duracell's in my remote controls. The ones I purchased in 2017 were comparable to their higher priced counterparts but the ones purchased towards the end of last Year were horrible in that I had 2 blow up. One in a FireTV remote and another in a Sony Sound Bar remote blowing the battery compartment covers off and sending the remotes flying off the end table, after I cleaned the battery compartments thoroughly I discarded the remainder of the 36 batteries. The few others I used before disposing them did not last very long compared to the earlier batch I received."
Ilya Shaikouski,Dead in no time.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used only Duracell and Energizer in the past. Was all happy and would forget where they are in the house between change times.Tried groccery store brand cheap ones - got 3 days in a fireTV remote. Laughed a lot but instead of getting good brands again - decided to give a shot to another cheaper option with amazon brand. Ended up with a very close result! Almost same as Wegmans...Do you guys try yourself what you selling? Amazon branded batteries last 4 days in amazon fire tv remote? Really? My fitbit lasts twice longer working much more than that on a tiny accumulator.Stay away from this product.
KC,Value for $ cannot be beat!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands-down the best-priced batteries anywhere I've ever seen! I've been buying these for years to use with my family and friends and I cannot imagine buying them anywhere else. They come in frustration-free packaging, they last as long, if not longer, than branded products, and they because of the larger volume, we never seem to run out 😂I would highly recommend these batteries, along with the AA and 9-Volt batteries as well!"
Sherzod,I'm dismayed!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 3 AAA batteries for my Gillette shaving handle. Well, it is disappointing to say but this item is absolutely useless. It didn't even last longer than 2 seconds. What I think is If the product doesn't' serve its main purpose you can't gauge/evaluate its other characteristics (look, design and etc.). It has to work so that people could say something about it. Basically, it is just sad that they sell these batteries under Amazon brand."
Brittany Carroll,DANGEROUS! AND A Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THESE!!! i put 2 in my clicker for me and my kids room. The clicker got so hot it burned my hand!!! It smelled like burning plastic and chemicals. Don't buy these. Im still horrified...what if my 5 y/I daughter had gotten there before me ....i tried 2 more. Same deal heated up alnost immediately . tried opening 2nd package. Same deal. Over and over. really unacceptable. 👎
Amazon Customer,They are dangerous to your toys and equipment,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This image is of a battery purchased January 2020, expiration date 2029, and installed into a toy car late June 2020. Battery removed late December 2020. Toy car damaged by battery.This oozing of electrolyte problem is something from the 1960's, not the 2020's. I have a Radio Shack timer purchased in 1978 with the original 1978 batteries that finally died a month ago: and they never leaked like this.It's one thing to leave alkaline batteries in something for 10 to 15 years and see some leakage, but months? Totally unacceptable."
Tre' c,I’m over it!,2.0 out of 5 stars,Like a dummy I keep these on auto order giving them the benefit of doubt. I noticed I was replacing these batteries after about a week or so of use. I kept thinking maybe I got bad batteries but this is the last time I’m giving these batteries and consideration. I’m updating my auto ship and I’ll leave you with the old saying... you get what you pay for! Buy the better battery (I won’t name them here but you know what I mean)
Lauren,Not as good as they used to be,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to love these batteries. I have been using them for years. I'm constantly changing them in our remotes. I bought AA and AAA at the same time. Both are having the same problem. Something else had to of changed besides just the packaging. Expiration dates just fine. Whatever it is, bring the old ones back."
Amazon Customer,Missing batteries,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought these batteries a couple of times before, no, they are not super batteries or anything but they've always worked just fine for what I use them for. Unfortunately this time when they arrived, the box was already opened and 8 batteries were missing, the box was inside of a larger box which was sealed, so I can only assume that they went missing before they were sent our for delivery. I know it seems like a small thing, but when you pay for something, you generally expect to receive all of it."
Sam,Leaking acid,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I found two of these batteries stored in the original packaging leaked acid. I am glad I did not have them in a product. They do not seem to have the capacity of another brand x battery as I have replaced them three times in one of two remotes with the same usage, while the brand x battery kept on working. Nothing scientific, just observation. Any battery that leaks is not worth the risk of a cheaper price."
Crusher,They suck they don’t last stick with the Costcos Kirkland brand on sale,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries suck are used to buy the ones at Costco‘s but it was too hard to tell which was positive and negative I don’t like Duracell because they leak I tried the Rayovac ones online they’re OK they’re not the best they always did suck are use rechargeable‘s now for the most part, and I went back to the Costco‘s brand as Duracell makes them. And they have good sales on them is when I buy them the Kirkland brand but these Amazon basics suck they don’t last.."
Branden,Careful they explode!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I got a battery powered pepper grinder from a gift exchange Xmas 2018. I had purchased some amazon batteries and I installed them. I just noticed that one of the batteries had exploded and leaked all over. The device does not work and there was acid leakage inside the container. I’ve never had a battery explode like this one did:
Hall Family,NO GOOD!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not purchase these batteries! They are useless, at least don't buy them in bulk because they don't last. We always buy batteries in bulk usually from Costco but these were much cheaper and there was a reason, they run out even when not using them. Our disabled child has a lot of toys and equipment that are battery operated that is why we but in bulk. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't buy these!"
Phillycutthroat,Amazon Owes Me A Refund For Poor Quality.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These Amazon batteries are utterly horrendous.They do not last and they leak like crazy. I'm so glad I found them leaking before my family got acid on their fingers. Danger, do not buy. One star because they made me choose."
Mackenzie,"Half worked, half did not",2.0 out of 5 stars,Seeing the reviews I was expecting these to work up to par with energizer batteries or Duracell: these did not.I got these to use along with an LED bandana I had purchased. I ordered two bandanas & when we put the batteries in one of the bandanas barely worked. I was very upset thinking the bandana was faulty & played with the batteries I had put in it. Nothing changed. Eventually ended up putting in another two of the batteries in the pack & it worked perfectly. It seems not all the batteries in my pack were good. Upsetting experience but the batteries that did work seemed to work for a decent amount of time; again these were nothing like energizer or Duracell so do not expect that quality.
Joe The Expert,Can’t beat the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading some of the negative reviews in here, I hesitate a lot to order. After all from my experience with amazon products I know they are properly not going to beat the high quality products on the market.This being said, I couldn’t beat the price. The quality brand I am familiar with was priced at 2x amazon basic brand. So, I figured to take a risk and get this one. The batteries don’t look like high end batteries but they definitely looking decent. Nothing look damaged, I assume the photo of damaged batteries by other users could be result of either shipping or storage.The batteries works as expected. I can’t speak for its longevity yet since I have had it for like a week. Will update my review on that after few months."
The Tenneys,Don't Last As Long as Other Brands,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There's a lot of bad hype out there regarding Amazon brand batteries, specific to them exploding or leaking. I've never had that issue, but I do find that these batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands. I'll forgo saving a few dollars on my next battery re-up and will get some Duracell or Energizer's.. maybe even some AC Delcos, have actually heard good things about them, but can't verify. Just can say that these are fine batteries that don't last as long as the name brands."
Serenity...,Stocking cabin for winter....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For some reason, these AAA batteries are not usually on my list for the winter. This year I did remember as the remote for my TV went 'dead'. So, luckily this jogged my memory.Have quite a few items that use this size battery so am glad I purchased these before the winter arrived.Personally I have never seen much difference between expensive batteries and those that are lower in price. And, that is probably because I only use them for radios...on occasion, remote controls and flashlights.Will update if these don't perform as expected.Highly recommended."
Trailer Boy,10-Year Shelf Life The batteries SO NOT!!!?!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I Purchased the 36 box of AAA amazon battery's.. and AA Amazon battery's. The web stated a 10 Year self life. I did not use these ""freshly sealed battery's"" for a year. I also purchased AA battery's....Well I used the AA battery right away-didnt really seem to have much issues at first- about 4 months down the road-the battery that I used was dead!?!! This was a ""door remote"" that gets pushed once a day !?!! That seem really short based on other battery's used in the past...but un scientific! So i figured well ""they are cheap and I have several of them -no big deal"". Time goes by and I find myself changing out the AA battery's more and more!?!! I NEVER even touch the AAA Amazon battery's... after A year or so -I use up all of the AA battery's!! Not happy with the life span - I order NON AMAZON brand battery's for replacements. Today I go to use The AAA Amazon battery's for a wireless mouse-All of them in the 36 Pack are door knob dead!?!!!""""10-Year Shelf LifeThe batteries use a patented triple layer structure in the cathode cad by adding a layer between the nickel and iron inside the battery. The result is an increased shelf life due to low leakage.""""Amazon is going to replace them-I had NEVER Ever had New sealed battery be dead -EVER?!! I know I had them over a year before used- But this is Amazing!?!I was on the fence about Just refunding the money to me- Or having them replaced....I decided to ""try again"" and have them replaced!?! Maybe just got a bad Lot??"
Hyytekk,"No doubt manufactured by the household name brands, just rebranded for Amazon, with a better price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We all go through a ton of batteries for everything from the mechanism that unlocks my doors to flash lights to remotes. And it seems they go bad at the worst possible times when replacing them must wait for a trip to the store so in the mean time your device is inoperative. I love to have a huge reserve supply, but the major brands can be pricey. Amazon obviously, doesn't manufacture their own, but buys in bulk and rebrands them, so essentially, you're getting those major brands anyway, with a different badge. I haven't done any formal testing, but they seem to have a sufficient service life and at a cheaper cost so I can keep a generous supply on hand. So far, highly recommended and a good value."
Replicant,Good batteries for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"AmazonBasics has really become a solid brand for so many household staples. These batteries are dependable and affordable, and if you can get them when the price dips down, it would be crazy not to grab some.I've seen some reviews that complained of leakage, but it sounds like some of those people left batteries in their devices for years. When you leave something sitting mostly unused for years, of course there is a risk of leakage. The risk is even greater if you've mixed batteries and created a power imbalance between old and new. I havent had any problems with AmazonBasics batteries leaking in everyday items such as my Amazon Fire Stick remote---but then I change them out regularly. Be sensible, and have reasonable expectations for a little pack of AAA batteries!"
Slmh,Do not last very long,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought Amazon Basics batteries in the past, but these are just not lasting long at all! We are using them for all of our remotes for TV's, etc and is seems like every week or so we need new ones. When I bought a big box of Amazon Basic AA, they seemed to last forever. I'm very dissappointed."
Stephen,Great alternative to those expensive name brands,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most Amazon branded products, these batteries are a great alternative to expensive name brands that you'll find at the checkout line in the supermarket. These batteries last a good amount of time, and you'll definitely see how purchasing the Amazon brand makes a quick economic benefit.When the battery is inside your product behind a cover, no one will no you aren't using Duracell! Definitely recommend stocking up on some batteries from Amazon and keeping them handy for a rainy day."
****Maxander****,Not Dependable AAAb attery,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've heard so much about these Amazon basics battery and lot of people seem to raves about it. I've always used Energizer or Duracell batteries my whole life. Figured, I will try them out and today I finally got the Amazon basics AAA batteries and put in some my kid's toys and flashlights. I noticed the flashlight isn't that bright and the toys sound and movement is that strong as the previous batteries so I used my battery tester to test how much power does it have. And I was pretty surprised, shocked and disappointed that how can this brand new battery is only a 1/4 green. It barely have any power left and It's brand new and its should all the way green(see pictures). I bought an 8 pack and I tested them all and they were all the same.Very Very disappointed with Amazon Basic battery. If you need good quality dependable battery I wouldn't recommend this battery."
Nick T.,Great batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the batteries. We subscribe to receive these every six months but they last longer then that in most devices such as tv remotes or under counter lights. We just have a very spoiled 4 year old that gets every toy he wants (my fault). So it’s pretty great to always have batteries on hand and not have to go out and buy some really expensive high end brand or some really cheap brand that last two days. These really did hold up longer than I expected very impressed.
Joe,Should be Amazon Amazing Batteries not Amazon Basic. Great prices and quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you haven’t tried Amazon Basics batteries what are you waiting for? There is nothing basic about them by the way. They should change the name to Amazon Amazing Batteries. They are priced much better than either of the big name brands. In my experience they outperform both low abs end version of those two big names as well. But we aren’t paying for advertising and when you buy these bulk packs you save on both accounts. Try them you got nothing to loose. If you aren’t satisfied you can return them. It’s Amazon after all. I keep a box of AA, AAA, and D size so I’ve always got them. Come hurricane season I refresh my layers and flashlights then place them in every room around the house. Everyone has their own color do. I arguing. Plus we know remote run down overnight especially if it gets wedged between the couch cushion or someone sets a book on part of it. Both things will keep the keyboard and it drains battery power. So I’m prepared should that happen, it has twice one of each example. So avoid the late night run for batteries for that gift or your kids game or baby’s favorite bedtime toy. Just buy in bulk and you’re covered. If you went around the house and counted you’d be surprised how batteries are in use right now, the number ALL the remotes is quite up there. Oh yeah with changing batteries you should change ALL at once to increase power and battery life. always be sure to dispose of used batteries properly. Hope this review was helpful."
K.,"short term life, good price",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are a great deal when you buy in bulk. They are super convenient for devices especially like remotes and household products.I use these fairly often, four at a time for a magnified, light up mirror and they last miserably short for a high performance battery. I get maybe a few hours overall max using the mirror before I need to replace them. The time they last has made me think that i’d rather switch to a rechargeable battery set than keep buying these.Only recommend for small devices like remotes snd computer mouses. These batteries don’t seem to do well on things that need a lot of power."
Nasha,Warning don't get wet!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Warning!!! Besides the fact these are pretty cheap and don't last super long for the price point, don't use these with water! I replaced the Energizer batteries in my facial scrubber that has never had issues and within two uses I noticed brown sludge in the cup I kept it in thinking I'm an idiot and left soda in a cup or something. Wash it out and next day more.brown sludge. Batteries were leaking rusty brown sludge and fully exploded. I had to throw my perfectly fine device away. Scary I could've not seen it and put battery acid or whatever all over my face"
aka_kristin,LIFE CHANGING BATTERIES,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries changed my life. Seriously. You have no idea. Thanks to these batteries my life has become 100% less stressful. My clocks are always on time and I'm no longer late to work all the time which means my boss has finally stopped writing me up for showing up late. Such a relief. And, don't get me started on my remote controls. You don't know stress until you realize that the newest episode of Supernatural started 5 minutes ago and generic batteries in your remote have died and YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL!!!! THANKS TO THESE BATTERIES I WILL NEVER MISS AN EPISODE OF SUPERNATURAL AGAIN!! Purchase these batteries!!! Trust me, you will thank me later."
Fernando,Great Value and Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the batteries that originally came in my remote for my fire stick, I use it almost daily and the batteries lasted over a year. I feel that these batteries are great quality and a great value."

Renie,"Good batteries, and great packaging, nice for keeping batteries in.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have yet to try these out, but want to comment on the great, common-sense packaging, which I can use to safely keep the batteries in, as I use them over time. First off, they come in an appropriately sized, sturdy box that can be reclosed ( not a blister pack as some others do). In addtion, every 4 batteries are encased in a plastic sleeve, so that as batteries are used out of the box, the remaining batteries do not fall over, which can lead to the terminals touching one another, (not a good thing, to my understanding (potential heat generation)).I'll comment further if the performance seems lacking, but if the packaging is an indication of the performance, they will be well worth the reasonable cost. UPDATE: Changed rating to 5 star, they seem to last as long as any other battery I've used."
Tennis lovr,These batts are Phat😏,4.0 out of 5 stars,I know they say that these r just as good as say bunny brand but not 4 me- I would say Ray-o-Vac level- like a vw vs audi- Toyota vs Lexus- Nissan vs Infiniti par-Not quite on longevity as really that’s the only comparo I say- all r bout same on output but.....I say buy these as $ is stoopid- Whatta deal when u look elsewhere- 10 packs are the same price dang near!Use these lots in family nerf wars so I can attest to these-we love n hate batteries don’t we!? What would we do w/o em!?!?Will buy again n again n again sadly❤️
Missy,Arrived dead,1.0 out of 5 stars,These Amazon high performance batteries arrived “dead”. I put them into a new flashlight I purchased from Amazon at the same time and it would not work. I thought the flashlight was broken until I bought Duracell batteries and the flashlight worked like a charm. So I basically just wasted $11 on the large pack of “high performance” batteries that were useless.
Sean,Get the job done,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm fairly happy with the batteries overall. As far as the price goes for a 36 count of batteries I couldn't be happier. They are also lasting longer than batteries I have used in the past, which may not say much because I would normally get batteries from the dollar store ha. However, I haven't had problems with these, since I purchased them, and I currently have pairs of the batteries in my TV remote, mouse, and calculator. My calculator normally burns through batteries rather fast, so I don't think I'm reviewing these batteries too soon. If I do run into problems, I will change this review."
dsk,17% Dead Batteries,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these batteries. But, 6 of them were dead, straight out of the box. That's almost 17% failure. I won't buy them again."
Courtdude,Missing Batteries,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been purchasing Amazon brand batteries for a few years now and I love the power for the price. This is the first problem that I have received but I felt it was worth mentioning. When the package arrive I noticed that it had been taped a 2nd time, as if someone had previously opened the package and returned it. The problem is that the box was 8 batteries short. Instead of the 36 batteries i ordered I received 28. i am hoping Amazon can make this right."
Lucky Clucker,Weird sizes!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are slightly different in size--not just from regular batteries, but from each other! And they SUCK. When they do fit, they don't last long--like maybe 3 weeks for stuff that barely gets used. These are terrible and I bought 3 different sizes (or lots of different sizes, based on what I got in this box, alone). I can't send them back because I just started realizing what garbage they are. I haven't even opened the other 2 boxes yet. Just spend the extra money for a battery that actually works. This teaches me for being cheap."
SALMONSLAYER,"Great Batteries, Great Value",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Batteries, Great Value. These batteries work just as well as the major brands. I get about the same run time as Duracell or Costco's Kirkland batteries. Buy the 100 pack and they are around 50% cheaper than anywhere else for quality batteries. I've used them for a few years now and really can't imagine switching unless amazon changes them for the worse."
JB,They don't last,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries burn up super quick. I started ordering Amazon brand batteries a year ago and I've never had to buy so many. This will be the last pack of this brand.
Michael,One of the best batteries out there! Hands down.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a ton of electronics and needless to say, having to replace batteries is in every day, ongoing issue. At the same time, I have tried out plenty of brands, sometimes going with the the high priced brand names, and at others settling with cheap generics. I cannot say that I've ever been overly happy with any of the high-priced well-known brands such as Coppertone Duracell's or the Energizer Ultimate's, but I will say that I have been thoroughly unimpressed with batteries that are too cheaply made and priced for that matter. Lastly, I've never been a fan whatsoever of any of the rechargeables. So in a nutshell, batteries and I are just not the best of friends — period. When I came across these ""Basic's"" a few years back, I was expecting just another poorly made product that I would no doubt have to replace every 2 to 3 days. But I thought, ""the least there's a ton of them, so can it be to wrong of a purchase."" All I can say was that I was blown away by how long they lasted in virtually everything I put them in, and I ranked them just as high in quality as other brands that are three times as expensive. Before long, I had replaced every battery in my house — regardless of size, with AmazonBasics. Now we've been so impressed with them that I decided to add them to my monthly Subscribe and Save orders. As I write this, I'm glancing at the seven different boxes of extras that I have yet to use sitting on my shelf. It's nice to have an excess quantity of a product such as batteries of which can really cause an issue for most (at least for me) whenever they go dead and yet there are none to replace them when needed. Just don't be fooled by the price or the brand name for that matter. These are just as good as the competitors if not better. Funny thing, my next-door neighbor with whom I barely know knocked on my door the other day asking if I had two AA batteries for which he could use. When I returned with 12 of them, he was shocked and at first refused to take them. With seven boxes to spare, or even if I had one box for that matter, it certainly wasn't an issue. Had I have done this with any other store-bought battery? Of course not. Not unless I wanted to freely give up $15 worth of batteries to someone I barely knew. I guess sometimes and people are happy, they try and let others share in their wealth."
KGB,Cheaper Is Not Better,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The AAA batteries do not have longevity. At least, not the box of batteries I received. School started Aug 24, 2020. This is the third time we are replacing batteries in the keyboard and mouse. (We have five students, and the one that has Amazon Basics batteries is the one having the most problems.) I will never buy Amazon Basics batteries again. I'd rather pay more with greater assurance of a quality product. I was wrong to think batteries are just batteries, it's just different packaging. They got me this time, but never again."
kenneth ,10 year shelf life is a lie,2.0 out of 5 stars,"batteries i recieved had an exparation date of 2027, this order was fufilled by amazon so there batteries have been in their warehouse for years aparently, I tend to use them up quickly so i dont care about the exparatioin date and they always provide the power and value i expect for the price but i am continualy dissapointed when i recieve amazon betteries because the exparation dates are nowhere near 10 years out, must are set to expire within 3 or 4 years of purchase in my experience. when i purchase a box of duracells with the 10 year shelf life claim they are always reasonably new manufectured with exparation dates far off in the future, maybe ive just had bad luck but amazon continues to ship me batteries that are afew years from exparation every time i order them, like i said i use them up quickly so its not to much of an issue to me but if your purchasing to keep on the shelf for a long time amazon batteries def arent for you."
bjrolland,only cells I buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying AAA and AA cells from Amazon for a few years now. I have yet to have one of them corrode in a device. I've lost devices to other brands, including Energizer and Duracell.I know they're all made in China now but for some reason the Amazon cells don't wreck my gear and the others have on several occasions. Are the Amazon cells made to higher specs? I don't know. I only know that they work well for a long time and don't ooze their guts and ruin my stuff. The price is right. Highly recommended."
Peter A. Hogg,Batteries Leaked and Destroyed The Charger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Check and see how these batterier distroyed my charger. Just threw a bunch away as they won't replace them or the charger.
Denise Rhodes,Great price for the quantity,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price for the quantity. My large family goes through a lot of batteries. Personally, I didn't see much difference between these batteries and name brand. Even rechargeable batteries loose their muster sooner or later. Not to mention many members kept throwing out the rechargeables. So, I switched to the Amazon Basic batteries years ago, and haven't switched back. I am not wasting a lot of money for less, and I don't have to stress about kids not keeping up with rechargeable. Then to save even more money, one can add the Amazon basic batteries to their subscribe and save."
Wooden Makeup,Great batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ended batteries when my mouse and remotes started losing power. So i went with these based on price. They are really good batteries and I like them a lot. I really like that they are wrapped every 5 batteries so you don't have open batteries sitting in a drawer. I did this with a huge thing of larger batteries in the same junk drawer and they all had dried battery acid all over the tips. I am not sure why but I guess they are all ruined from being exposed. So i am glad when I saw that they are shipped protected in sets. No problems, have had them for a month and like them a lot."
Tony H.,Good number of batteries for a good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are seemingly good batteries as they advertise a long shelf life and everyone knows how disappointing when you go get a battery only to find out they are expired or the voltage has begun to decrease over time. I have checked the voltage on a number of them when I needed one and found they were all up to par. About the only thing I dislike is as each battery is wrapped separately with a very good covering, they are difficult to remove without a knife or screwdriver. But again I feel good about the purchase and will buy more."
Lisa,My Go-To Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the past several years, when I purchase batteries, the Amazon batteries have been the best deal. I have purchased them in 9 Volt, AA, and AAA and had zero issues. Once I throw batteries into something, I tend to not think about it, so the batteries have seemed to last as long as I expect them to last. The packs come with so many that I need a battery organizer to keep up with them, lol. Will continue to buy the packs of Amazon Batteries unless I run into a quality issue down the road. Recommended!"
Joseph J. Truncale,Great AAA batteries for a bargain price from Amazon.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently ran out of AAA batteries and decided to purchase this bargain priced pack (Amazon Basics 20-county AAA high-performance alkaline batteries, 10 year shelf life, easy to open value pack) from Amazon. I was happy with the very quick service and as soon as I received them I replaced the AAA batteries in my flashlights and television channel changers.I am very happy with my purchase and the price was fantastic for these 20 AAA batteries.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Mighty Pen: Your self-defense friend)"
Jes,Cheaper in Bulk,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Haven't had chance to test these, but if they last even a couple months that's better than some batteries I've paid more for. First time buying household batteries online, and they are so much cheaper in bulk. I don't need 36 AAA, but I will now likely never need to buy AAA batteries again! Only needed 8, but the price difference was like $3 to go from 8 to 36, so why not? Hopefully they have decent longevity, otherwise I will be needing all 36... however, even if I do, for the price I'm ok with it."
Sweet Kitty,"FAIL! Shame on you, Amazon!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just stocked up on some AAA batteries and bought Amazon's Basic brand AAAs. I installed them yesterday and they didn't work. I had to use another brand I had. I am stunned that Amazon would sell me dead batteries. Shame on Amazon. Shame on you! You sold me a defective product, now I'm out the money I spent to buy these."
Pete J,Short life,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a 36 pack to use in a few flameless candles. Went through the whole box already in only two months. Very short life, I expected more from Amazon."
tiasreads,Rare Disappointment From Amazon Basics,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been consistently impressed by the Amazon Basics products I've tried in the past, but their batteries are the exception. Besides the AAA's, I've also tried the D and C size. I've had some that came out of the package dead, even when the package was new. My remote controls (especially my Roku remotes) burn through these batteries in a heartbeat, far more quickly than Energizers or my preferred brand, Member's Mark from Sam's Club. It was convenient to just order them with Prime shipping, but I'll be stocking up at Sam's in the future."
Cboyer,New Packaging is Terrible.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like these batteries. They seem to last as long as the big name brands, but at a better price. However, Amazon changed the packaging and the new design is terrible. I received an order today and half of the 4 packs slipped out of the box and were loose in my package. In addition to that the plastic came off two of the 4 packs so there were 8 batteries completely loose in the package with the other items I ordered. The old packaging for these batteries also served as a nice way to store them until needed. The new packaging isn’t sturdy enough to be used this way."
Debaware,Change your Amazon remote batteries less often!,5.0 out of 5 stars,This a great Amazon product for value & money. I take care of my disabled father. My father has always had a weird affinity for flashlights. Ive found dozens and dozens of flashlights over the years and many if them take AAA batteries. But the reason you want these (and me too) is for your Amazon remote control. Keep a pack close by so when you get that frustrating little message you'll have plenty of Amazon batteries available for your Amazon remote. You'll change them less often with these.
Brian ,Back for the buck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Depending on what device I need batteries for, I would either go with cheap batteries at the local 99 cents store or with the expensive Energizer or Duracell brand.I wanted to give the Amazon brand batteries for once and pulled the trigger on triple A battery pack.I needed these for the remote control, mouse for my laptop, and mustache trimmer and so far these batteries have lasted with good power and doesn't appear to drain fast as it would with knock-off or cheap batteries."
Rami,"Feels flimsy, but does the job",2.0 out of 5 stars,"These really feel flimsy, made out of plastic, and seem like they would not last a long time. Well, they have lasted me a few months, using them once or twice a week. I bough them so that I could use them occasionally in place of my LG Tones, which are much more expensive, when I go running and doing other physical actives (basically to protect the Tones which I like a lot and give them a longer life). If you keep in mind the price you pay for these, then you would be satisfied with their performance overall."
Carol,Worst batteries ever purchased.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The batteries have an extremely limited power life. The two in my wireless mouse lasted for about 6 weeks. I use my computer an average of 2-3 hours a day, and the mouse is turned off when it is not in use. In my Roku remote, they lasted for approximately 3 weeks. Do not buy these batteries!"
Karin Wasserman,Amazon AAA 1.5 volt batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered a product that required AAA batteries. So I bought 30 batteries for the same price as a small package of Duracell only 12 count for the same price and got over twice as many by going with the Amazon brand. That is a considerable savings. A lot more bang for the buck. Time will tell how long lasting they will be. I am happy with my purchase.
Matt,No power,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good price.... but (update 12/21/2016)Update - horrible batteries. Have gone through 8 out of 48 batteries and none have worked. Contacted Amazon, they state they will refund my money and apologized. Great customer service,but horrible product.Be aware of the refund/return policy with Amazon. Batteries are something I don't test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 AA's in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Tried 2 more.... nothing. Tried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what?)... nothing again. Tried it my TV remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage.While the product gets 1 star (that's too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars."
John,Very annoying packaging,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There’s nothing wrong with these batteries. They work fine. They’re cheap. They come with my monthly Amazon shipments.Perfect, right?No, unfortunately not. I have no idea why Amazon feels the need to overpackage these batteries so much. They come in sets of three, in cellophane wrappers that are impossible to tear with your hands. So you have to cut each set of three with a knife and if you bought any larger quantity of them (which you usually do using Subscribe and Save) it takes a long time to go through them all. Not to mention the unnecessary waste of all those pointless wrappers which are packaged inside a little corrugated cardboard box anyway, then put into another Amazon box with whatever else you ordered.I’ve bought these in AA and AAA several times, but I’m done. I’ll spend a little more to get name brand batteries in packaging that doesn’t pss me off so much."
Debbie ,As good or better than expensive brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries seem to last as long, if not LONGER than name brand batteries. This is my second time buying a box, and I'm still very impressed!!"
Kevin Kelsey,"Well, they are batteries.  Just not good ones.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch?"
Elizabeth Jo Stephenson,Lasts Longer Than Most Name Brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these in ALL the Remotes in my House and have been for the last few years. They cost less than some others I've tried and they last a lot longer. I really noticed the difference when my PC Mouse died, I'd used a name brand battery and they only lasted 6 months! I always date Batteries, Chargers, Cables, etc. to tract longevity and the Amazon batteries in my Mouse now are going on 9 months of everyday use, gaming included! My search for Batteries is over!"
SSung,This battery is good as other brand names!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My brother and I decided to try the amazon batteries because the price was better and the reviews were pretty decent. Now that I tried several times and bought several times, I can actually say these are just as good as the other name brands. My brother and I did the testing and these batteries lasted just as long as the other ones. So, I know these last and works marvelously. I enjoy buying the value packs because I don't have to worry about running out. I'm giving these batteries two thumbs up!!!!!"
Amazon Customer,Don't last long,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not lasting as long as they used to. Both C and AA amazon batteries are dieing within weeks of being installed. I use the AA for game controllers and it will only last a few weeks. (Brand new controllers)Also a touchless sink that takes C batteries will go only a month. Should last a year. I am switching back to higher quality batteries in hopes I don't have to keep running around my house replacing batteries in everything on a regular basis.Sick of Amazon brand.
Vienna,It was okay,2.0 out of 5 stars,I tried different brands of AAA batteries. This brand have half of the power versus other brand. I used the same machine with this brand of batteries and then I used another brand name in the past. This is the result that I got. This brand last only two weeks versus the other one last about four weeks.
David L.,What do I know?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought I did a review for Amazon batteries already but whatever. They seem to be good enough batteries for the price. I really don't know and can't say for sure though. I have not done my own scientific comparisons with all kinds of side by side matching to see what powers what best and when. All I know is we always need batteries here at home and since I'm making an Amazon order for something or another already, might as well just throw some more batteries in with the order too. Helps if it's a small order to begin with and you just need to buy a little something extra to get free shipping or something. I have bought them in the past and will probably buy more in the future."
Katie,Great deal- don't pass these up! Can never have too many AAA's around.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great deal- don't waste any more money buying batteries at the store! You can't beat the price and they work and lask as well as ""brand name"" batterys. It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great! With AA and AAA size I'd recommend buying a bigger pack- yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me you'll be glad you got extra- it's one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked."
Pete,Good price but don’t last that long.,4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price they seem ok but for a few extra dollars the name brands last twice as long in the same devices.I basically am just using these now for my remote controls and thermostat cause they don’t use much power and the batteries will last longer.Any item that requires a lot more juice I use name brands otherwise these will drain to quick and they won’t be cost effective.2 of these in a wall clock died after less than 2 weeks.
R. Kumar,Very poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are crappy to say the least. They drain in almost no time. I have tried multiple packs of them, initially believing that my devices had been left on or something. Later on I realized that it was the batteries that were the issue. All they are good for is to pollute landfills."
Max,Great job to amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love these batteries, and not for the reason they are better or worse then other batteries. They are batteries and they work. I love them because of how awesome the packaging is. I have a 4aaa dispenser and these come in a 4 pack wrapped in plastic. Normally I have this big clunky plastic tub to contend with. But this I have a neat little box( about the size of a dvd but a little different) that is easy to open and close and a awesome 4 pack can be removed and my dispenser can easily be filled. The box of 32 easily fits in my bag or on a book shelf. Great job to amazon"
Trevor,they appear to be batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wont know if they actually last very long or hold up without using them, but i'll make sure to come back in a month or so with an update on value.When they first arrived, the package only had a 12 pack of batteries and a 8 pack of batteries in side, i was worried i misread the item description and didnt buy the right amount, amazon very quickly resolved this issue for me and i dont feel so crazy"
R. Miller,Shelf life disappointing......,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased (36 pack) in December 2018, ALL (remaining 28) DEAD OUTTA BOX BY SEPTEMBER 2019. Had used 4-8 before today, in remotes w/no problems that I recall....Checked my past purchases, & had bought (36 pack) 5 times prior... never had problems before. Don’t know if as a bad “batch” or whatever was the problem. Had previously purchased Sony batteries on Groupon, before my last 5 times (of 36 packs- so quite some time) , & never had problems w/Sony batteries ( a decent battery economically)... so bottom line being, will go back to Groupon for Sony batteries next time... this is MY 1st BAD DEAL ON AMAZON, that’s saying something— I love the company, just not so much their Name brand product .... IN THIS CASE.... .. bummer..."
Ty.,Always there when you need them!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying, I haven't sat down and performed controlled tests on the longevity of these batteries. That being said, they seem to last just as long as anything else out there. They're a good deal for how many you get, and they always arrive incredibly fast. That means that when I grab the last couple of batteries from my current stash, I can hurry and buy more and know they'll be here quick. Sure beats trying to remember that I need some next time I go to the store. For convenience of getting them plus the fact they seem to last long enough for my needs, easy choice to pick these up."
ScottD9,Amazon Basic Batteries Far Exceeded My Expectations.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Basic batteries far exceeded my expectations. I have purchased the large multi-pack batteries in stores before and they are a waste of money. I was not expecting much better when I ordered the Amazon Basics, but I was pleasantly surprised. I originally bought the AA batteries to use in my digital camera and they exceeded the performance of the Duracell and Eveready batteries I normally buy. I quickly bought the AAA batteries and they are great as well. No need to waste money on the big battery companies again. I will definitley stick to Amazon Basics."
Amazon Customer,Box was empty. No batteries inside!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received what appeared to be a sealed box. When I opened it there was nothing inside but a pamphlet describing what was supposed to be in the box. The order of AAA batteries was not in it. I noticed an end flap was broken which is obviously how the batteries were either removed or fell out.I need a replacement ASAP. Thank you
AB,Not worth the penney,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had a lot of batteries the pasts, And use rechargeable batteries for years. But I'm sad to say Amazon AA's AAA's batteries are the worst I've ever had. Not only do they leak and rule in your expensive hardware. But the longevity is ridiculously small. Do yourself a favor avoid Amazon batteries at all costs pay the extra money for good batteries when it comes to rechargeables. The old saying holds true here, you get what you pay for, Or maybe less when it comes Amazon batteries."
mky44,Long Lasting and as a good as Name Brand Products,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
Rosemary,Terrible quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These may be less expensive, but the lifecycle cost is much higher than better brands. They used to be great, but now some of these only last for a week or so, whereas Duracell and Energizer last months running the exact same clock. Once in awhile, you get lucky and the batteries last a bit longer, but forget storing them. They lose power on the shelf, where other batteries retain charge. Don’t waste your time and money with these. It looks like a great deal, but in the end it will cost you more."
influence peddler,They work fine and last a long time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used the triple a and double a amazing batteries off and on for a while. I haven’t had any issues with them being poor performing, corroding, or exploding (I’ve heard batteries do that but I’ve never experienced it). I’ve had the same triple a batteries from amazon in my remote like a year and they’re still performing well. I recently stocked up on every battery size amazon makes to go into a bug out prep collection. The pricing is pretty fair on the batteries too especially considering there is no discernible quality issue with the batteries."
Will and Kat,I am now an advocate for these batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I posted an entire review about the ""C"" batteries but I will reiterate here. I was once scared of the generic battery. I was scared that if I did not use the name brand, super expensive battery that I would be doing a disservice to whatever toy or electronic I was putting them in. This is not the case with these batteries. I know that there are batteries out there that are generic and have not worked as well but I am here to vouche for these batteries. I have been using them in everything and bought all the different kinds because of how well they worked and the value. The value for this amount of batteries and the quality of these batteries cannot be beat anywhere else. They have outlasted the expensive kinds in my daughters toys and in the things that I have placed them in around the house. I have not been disappointed and I was floored by the price. I do not mean to prattle on but I cannot say enough about these toys. As it gets closer to Christmas, parents all around are stocking up on batteries, I know I am. I have bought a pack of AAA, AA, and C just for Christmas. I could not believe the savings and you will not be disappointed with the quality. I am now an advocate for Amazon batteries. They do not disappoint!"
Gungo,BEWARE - Oxidation at both ends. Rusted and unusable after only a few months.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased Amazon Basic rechargeable batteries for years - and they are normally great. This batch looks different than the others and within a few months. are completely rusted. They are stored with all other batteries and never got wet - but both ends of the batteries have so much rust that you can not recharge them. In fact, even the pre-charged batteries that were never used are worthless since no charge gets through the rust. I've tried to sandpaper them but nothing seems to work. Since its past the return date - I guess the solution is to just throw them away and not order Amazon Basics in the future."
gejome,"I'm not sure what ""Remote Control "" evaluation means in the rating inquires >",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally, I ordered this product which seemed to last reasonably well , then on follow up orders, looking for longer ""use life"", I tried several different brands, (Sony, Eveready,ray-o-vac, duracell), all with disappointing outcomes. Shelf life was greatly reduced, and contrary to advertised promises, most of the batteries started leaking corrosive fluids half way through their usefulness , so I'm going back to Amazon Basics, a product I've never had acid leakage !. The prices are fair, and the trustfulness is assured ! ! !"
andy_tony14,Poor quality from AmazonBasics,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've trusted Amazon with a lot of their AmazonBasics products (haven't had an issue with most of them) and I've bought several packs of their batteries. But having had these batteries in multiple products for extended periods of time I've come to the conclusion they are costing me more than name-brand batteries in the long run. I've started to notice that my kid's toys don't last nearly as long as they should before I'm replacing them again - and it's happened enough that I can't blame it on leaving the device in the 'on' position too long. Probably the most noticeable for me is my USB mouse. With Energizer or Duracell, I could easily go 6 months without having to replace the batteries. Now I feel like I'm getting 2, maybe 3 months tops before I'm replacing with more batteries. Once I run out of my current packs of batteries, I won't be getting these again."
Eric H,"Only batteries I will be ordering from now on, don't waste money on dollar store batteries",5.0 out of 5 stars,"For a long time I whenever I would go to Harbor Frieght I would grab a pack of their cheap batteries and think ""even if they suck it's only a couple bucks so who cares"". Turns out I have been wasting my money for years on that junk. Even though these are a little more they last 10x longer than Harbor freight or dollar store batteries and you get a lot more for your money.Anyone interested in seeing the exact numbers a guy on Youtube by the name of Project Farm did a pretty thorough test on a bunch of different battery brands and Amazon was actually near the top for value. If you search project farm battery I'm sure it will pop up, it's a pretty cool watch"
LegoGirl,Basically fine!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They may be “basic,” but they're a good value for households who plow through batteries on a regular basis. I appreciate that they are shrink-wrapped into into packets containing 4 batteries each; makes it easier to keep extras in a backpack or glove compartment or drawer (and you can be sure that are 4 batteries are the same age when using them together)."
JChamberlain,These batteries lost power MUCH more quickly than other AAAs,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We tend to go through too many batteries in our house, and the price seemed right for these. We have also generally had good luck with Amazon Basics products, however these AAA batteries were not even worth the cheaper price offered. Whether in our children's' toys, flashlights, or night lights, these quickly needed replacement, and much more quickly than comparable name brand or generic AAAs. I won't be buying these again."
HiThere,"Great Batteries, Great Price",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been receiving these batteries through Amazon Subscribe and Save for a while. You can't beat the price and I can't tell any difference, performance wise, than the Duracell batteries that I used to buy for double/triple the price. They're well made and I've never had any leakage or damage from them. Definitely recommend these. Hope this was helpful!"
Chingadero,Poor Quality - Dead Out Of The Box,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a box of these this time last year. Stored them in my desk drawer. Pulled out 3 of them for an LED light I have and they were stone DEAD! The label on them has an expiration date of 2027. I've seen fresh fish with a longer shelf life. Utter garbage.Although they say they have a 10 year shelf life Amazon won't stand behind their own brand. They ripped me off, don't let them rip you off too."
H C,Good Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical to get these at first, but it seems they do last as long as other well known brands. But I did not test and compare them. I do love the packaging more than others that use plastic or ones that have fully sealed plastic where you need scissors to open them. Much better in cardboard and earth friendly."
chappella,Not worth your $,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible quality. They do not last and we have been only been using for remote and having to change out every one or two days and we only watch television for an hour or two after work. Not worth the effort at even the low cost.
MistyB,Works like a charm!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading the reviews on these batteries, I decided to give it a shot! At first I was only using them for my kiddos toys because let’s face it, they get turned on and forgetfully aren’t turned off right after use... I was surprised at the longevity of these amazon brand batteries and I actually bought a few more packs!! What a great deal! I definitely recommend!"
Kort,My Go-To Battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used tons of brand name batteries over the years from copper top to pink bunny, but lately I keep coming back to these Amazons offering. For the price, it's hard to beat AmazonBasics AAA 1.5 Volt Performance Alkaline Batteries. If you don't need or want rechargeable, it is hard to go wrong here. They last and perform well, and what more could you ask for? I've never had any quality issues with them leaking or not doing what they're supposed to do. If you're looking for a reliable battery, then AmazonBasics Performance Alkalines are up to the task.~ Kort"
Mom of 3 ,Battery snob and Super Happy with this purchase!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a battery snob and I usually never bother with off brands. I have been successful in using other amazon branded products and wanted to give these a try. I am so glad that I decided to try these because I really do not think I will use another battery brand. Great price and work just as long as energizer or Duracell brand batteries. I have had no leaks issues or duds. I am super happy with these batteries and would recommend to a friend. In fact I actually recommended these to my mother and she couldn’t be happier with them either.
Lyn,Great price for these alkaline batteries.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't buy any other batteries for my needs around the house but these. I don't even buy Costco's Kirkland brand because these are just as good as Duracell or Kirkland and last as long and cost sooo much less. Buy quantity 36 and store them on your bench. They will last a very long time and be ready for use whenever you need them. Don't get caught needing batteries and having to go to Walmart and pay $1 per battery, yes, that's what they cost for the same kind of battery."
SDHeeter,Very short lifespan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We used these for under the cabinet LED lights. 4 batteries in each one... Lasted less than 2 hours. For LEDs? The AA batteries did poorly on my xbox controller also, less than 1 day.What are they good for?1) Maybe a tv remote....2) Maybe a garage door opener...3) Definitely filling a landfill quickly!"
FromFarEast,"3+ year user, no issues or complaints. Compared to Duracell and Energizer.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using AmazoBasic batteries for toys, flashlights, remotes for at least 3 years now. I never had any issues with them. For the value, I can't quite say anything negative about this. AmazonBasic batteries seem to last just as long as Energizer Industrial or Duracell. That said, I have found AmazonBasic batteries to often be much cheaper, which makes it such a great product. I see myself continuing to purchase AmazonBasic batteries for as long as they keep making quality batteries."
Tina C,Work great,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried the EBL batteries and other batteries because they are cheaper, but they do not last as long as these do. I had these and the EBL in two different snow globes that ran on a timer. The timer was the same on both. These batteries are still going strong while the EBL have stopped working. After this happened I ordered more of these because they are still cheaper then a lot of the big brands, but work better."
SAS,I never knew I could have this much energy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If someone had told me how this product could change my life, I would not have believed them. Before this miracle of the modern age arrived on my doorstop, I and my electronic products were dull, lifeless - LITERALLY couldn't even move. But now!! Apply the product following the instructions and BUZZ WHIRRRR CLAP CLAP CLAP I just can't stop! Even when things start to slow down a little BAM fresh application from my box full of energy and I'm on the go again. Get some for yourself! You won't be sorry!"
AngWms,Kudos!!  Insulin Pump Running Strong!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to give these a try due to the massive number of AAA batteries I use each month. I am a Type 1 Diabetic on the insulin pump 24/7. The most expensive batteries on the market last a maximum of 4 days. I inserted the Amazon battery in my pump on March 4, 2019. It is still going strong and I have full power 10 days later!!!! I truly stand amazed. I have NEVER had a battery touch this. I only wish I had these batteries 17 years ago.Kudos Amazon for passing the pump test. None ever have. I will be a customer for life!"
Steppin' Time,Great Batteries for the Money!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to update all the remote and flashlights, they really did last a very long time. The ones on the Remote were dated 2017 and now they've all been marked 01/2021. The Flashlights, it all depends on how often you've had to use the Flashlight, they hold up their charge for a pretty long time, I replaced all 4 of them because the batteries were getting weak. All of them were installed in 2019!"
A. McK.,Just Fine,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't had mine for very long, so they haven't started leaking or anything weird. Rather hoping they don't start doing that. Honestly, they seem fine, and we get this brand at work all the time. They live a good long shelf life as far as we can tell. Calculators do seem to eat through them pretty fast, but those darn things destroy any and all batteries. Overall, these are perfectly fine."
T. Day,A very good battery at a very good price.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you seen what Duracell and Energizer batteries cost in retail stores? What a ripoff. I think most of what you're paying for is the cost of advertising and retail displays.I've used Amazon alkaline batteries around the house for years. And we also use them in test equipment where I work. In my experience, they last just as long as the major brands for a lot less money."
A.J.L,"Value, Value, Value (And Convenience Factor)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been ordering Amazon Basics batteries for quite some time now and I am sticking to them because of the value. The smaller name brand packs at the store cost much more per battery so I like to buy in bulk. I have seen the battery tests on YouTube and read that there are others that perform better, however, I really don't notice much of a difference and I really enjoy the convenience factor!"
D John,Great Buy - BUT,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's Christmas and I have 11 window candles that require 3 batteries each, and those need to be replaced once before they come down. Hence this purchase. It's a great deal on a per-battery basis, BUT they are shrink wrapped in groups of 5, and are fiendishly difficult to get out of the wrap. It took me longer to free up the batteries than it did to install them and place the candles."
Capt Pierce,Excellent batteries at a great price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched to the Amazon brand batteries years ago because I was sick and tired of paying crazy prices for name brand, alkaline batteries. The Amazon brand batteries work just as well and last just as long as the popular name brands but are less expensive. Why anyone would continue to buy the popular name brands and pay more when they can get a high quality, long lasting battery Amazon is beyond me. I highly recommend the Amazon brand alkaline batteries in AAA, AA, C and D cell sizes. Excellent quality!"
Jack Erwin,Good Value ! Great Packaging !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is no noticeable difference between the AmazonBasics AAA Cell battery and the big brand name product.I like the packaging much better. They come in a box with several batteries wrapped in plastic. The others insist on using blister packs. It is hard to open them, then they all roll out. This may be good for advertising in store displays but not so much when you get them home. I like the box."
Sehyun Kim,"Came with batteries loose and missing batteries, but it seems Amazon will replace one set for free",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these batteries before and I think they're fine, I don't really pay attention to the performance that much. I'm sure they're pretty standard.The only reason I'm docking a star is because I ordered this and my first set somehow got slightly opened, and almost half of the batteries were out of their plastic wrap and just sitting in the package outside of the box.Thankfully, when I tried to submit a return/replacement, they sent over a replacement free of charge, without any need to return my original set of batteries.The replacement set of batteries came today and they were all in the box; however, one set of 4 batteries was missing, so there were only 32 batteries in there.So all I have to say is, be weary of missing or loose batteries when you order this. But at least you have some assurance that they will replace it hassle-free if you do have an issue."
Marco,Poor longevity in LED flashlights,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The batteries first appear to have a good price. When initially installed, it seems like you are getting the quality of a name-brand battery at a significant discount. But used in bright LED flashlights, these have well under half the use time as the more expensive name brands. I estimate that useful battery life-per-dollar-spent is roughly the same as a name brand. So why use a name brand instead if the true cost is about the same? It is a pain to have to install bateries in devices 2 or 3 times as often; even if the cost is the same, my time has value as well. I recommend buying any of the name brand batteries in bulk on Amazon or at a big-box store. I do not recommend these."
A. Parks,Excellent Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll admit that I am usually a name-brand kind of guy when it comes to retail products. I know, the psychology of marketing has gotten me; I'm a lost cause. But AAA batteries really aren't very high stakes, and I like the simplistic design/visuals of most Amazon Basics products, so I gave these a go.So far, everything works great. I've only used 1 of the batteries in my 8-pack thus far. If I notice a particularly large dip in performance or longevity I will update with a new review. But for now, they're exactly what I expect."
Amazon Shopper,These batteries DO NOT last very long,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life of these basics is awful!!! Literally last maybe a little longer than half of the Duracell batteries I usually buy. Even if these basics are cheaper, how can you justify with half the battery life?!?!? It would have to be less than half the cost of better batteries to justify. And even then, you’re just being incredibly wasteful!Just buy a better brand and avoid these!"
BIG D N LV,Leaked and ruined my meter,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a 100 pack of these AAA batteries on 4-28-17. I previously used AC Delco batteries exclusively, good life, good price, and never leaked. I have a nice meter I use to test capacitors with. I needed it last week and was getting crazy readings so thought maybe a battery change was in order. removed battery cover and 1 of the 3 batteries had a serious leak and it migrated to the circut board and I think my meter is toast, a loss of about $60. I have around 20 amazon batteries left that I will just put in my box of batteries that get recycled. I will not be using these ever again. I have read a lot of reviews and leaking seems to be a common problem. Amazon needs to raise the quality standards for their battery suppliers of get new ones."
Robert Thomas,Weak inferior 1.5 batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If your going to sell batteries they should be fully charged. Everyone else manages. I installed two in my fire stick remote on Friday night, come Sat morn the remote wouldn't work. The batteries were at half strength. The fire stick remotes are a poor product anyway they eat up batteries like crazy but I've never had them eat one up overnight so I took the package that holds maybe 10 or 15 without removing it I scratched away the plastic on the negative and positive and put the ohm meter and sure enough they weren't 1.5 they were barely one and maybe 1.1 or 2 this is a state of failing of a battery already. Go out and buy any standard battery out there and it'll be 1.5 plus I'm close to 1.6 and in a strong state. Let's put it this way my remote for the TV has had the same two 1.5 batteries in it for 8 months. The fire stick remote I'm changing them every 3 months so what I'm saying to Amazon you got lousy batteries you got lousy remotes too."
Mariner,Horrible batteries.,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are horrible batteries for tv remote control. I bought 2 sets of these and I have to swap out batteries about ok once a week cause they die quickly. Will not buy again.
Janet Haskell,Life-Changing! My Go-To Battery Supply,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in my 50’s and FINALLY learned to keep a decent supply of batteries on hand. All those years of scrambling for batteries, rushing out to buy more, being frustrated when I realize I need batteries but the stores at closed and being mortified by the high cost of a little 4 pack - finally those days are over!I feel like a real adult now. Life-changing!!Seriously, do yourself a favor and be prepared with a decent stockpile of batteries at a respectable price.Cons: Everyone in my family now knows I always have batteries so they no longer bother to buy their own. Instead, they just dig into my stash. Uggg! I may or may not be contributing to enabling my grown children’s personal growth.I need to start hiding these little gems :)"
Connie P,Decent batteries at a good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I normally buy Duracell or Energizer batteries because they work well and they last. The one time I tried some dollar store (size D) batteries and, brand new, they didn’t even have enough power in them to properly run my child’s (Elefun) game! This is the first time I have purchased an off-brand since. These Amazon batteries seem to work well. Even if they don’t last as long as my usual battery brands, since they are significantly cheaper, I should still be saving money in the long run. If I have problems with the batteries long-term, I will update this review accordingly."
Nadia Orand,CHEAPLY MADE & FALLING APART & NO QUALITY CONTROL,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the AAA Amazon batteries and when I went to use the batteries, I found a few batteries that were falling apart like shown in the picture, where the insides of the battery were exposed. Because I found the batteries that were falling apart after the one month ""return"" policy for AMAZON, there was nothing I could do. Below average quality, pay a little more knowing that the batteries you are going to receive are actually working batteries."
Lee Duncan,Power in a small package!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"AmazonBasics AAA 1.5 Volt Performance Alkaline Batteries - Pack of 36 pack many hours of long lasting performance in such a small size. All your AAA devices will love these as there batteries given the constant stable power output of these 1.5 volt alkaline batteries. Don't waist your money on name brand batteries or off brand ones either. AmazonBasics AAA Alkaline Batteries out preform and last those for much less in cost. So, add some to your cart now."
Jin Oh,"AmazonBasics batteries are the best value, hands down",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have about a million battery-powered toys and gadgets around the house. I spent a few years investing in Eneloop rechargeables (which are great), but you have to make sure they're all discharging the same plus you lose some and end up constantly buying more. Duracells are 8 bucks for a pack of 4 AAs here, 6 bucks per D cell, 10 bucks per 9V, which is ridiculous. Kirkland batteries are cheap but leak, and have destroyed so many electronics over the years. ""Heavy duty"" cells are as useless as they are cheap. I now have subscriptions for AmazonBasics AAA, AA, C, D, and 9V and life is so much simpler. I never bothered to test them despite packaging or production changes over the years, but so far they work well and don't leak. That's all I want. I don't care whether or not they discharge faster than Duracells because Duracells sure aren't worth 10 times more than these."
brownize54,You need to replace them every 2 days. Terrible product.,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are terrible. I put 3 of them in a timer candle that turns on for 6 hours and then turns off. They lasted two days. I replaced them and the same thing happened again. So I’ve gone through 6 batteries in 4 days. They’re a waste of money.
Kia,Little battery big punch,5.0 out of 5 stars,We were in some need for some aaa's for our flashlights so we could see the raccoons coming up on us lol and this 36 pack is a lifesaver! Not only do we have enough batteries to last a few months but they last for quite some time. I've only had to change the batteries once so far and I purchased them a little over a month ago so they seem to do all right for themselves
teddtlove,Do not buy this is from the Amazon Shopping Queen,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are horrible. We used them almost exclusively in our Fire remotes. We have three. We were changing batteries like every two weeks in each remote or something like that. Some of the batteries were duds right out of the pack. I would have sent the back but we didn’t open the right away so the 30 past before we knew it. I love amazon but do not but these
Tracie Hotchner,AVOID these batteries they leak!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have gotten many AAMzon basics products that are terrific quality and value- but DO NOT buy Amazon's batteries. i store them in individual plastic bags in a dry cool container yet find they leak and leave crystals even after only a few months kept in ideal conditions. I have never ever experienced that with everready, duracell or any other brand. really bad factory defect I guess?"
RobB,"Dead in the box, in less than two years",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a box of 36 these AAA batteries in December 2018. I've got about half remaining, and they're now totally dead. And the ones I've installed in devices have died also. Energizers last 5 years, so buying the cheaper Amazon brand was a very poor choice."
delump,Price to performance - Unbeatable!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Are these the longest life battery out there? No, but they are much better than the cheap ones and aren't much worse than batteries lasting 10% longer. Twice the price for 10% more life - do the math!Bottom line, the price to hours of use just can't be beat! I only buy these."
Jessica Dougherty,Great life-span on these batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We seem to go through batteries SO fast with all the toys and electronics that my kids and husband have. I feel like I was always running out and buying more batteries and they seemed SO expensive. We decided to try out the AamazonBasics batteries because they are cheaper than purchasing in the store...and because they are delivered to my front door and I don't have to remember to grab them at the grocery store or make a special trip out to get batteries. So far we've been really impressed with these batteries. I was afraid that they would be like the super cheap ones you can get at the dollar store and not really have much life to them and have to replace them even more frequently. We've been using them in several well-loved (read used all the dang time!) toys as well as some electronic devices and we haven't had any issues with them not having a good life span to them. We will definitely purchase these again when our supply gets low - thanks for an affordable, easy option to the seemingly never-ending need for batteries!"
Lyle B.,Tests show these are the best buy for the money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently reviewed a test on YouTube were they tested most of the major brands of batteries. This was not a test completed by a testing company, but rather an intelligent fellow that tested a number of products. When comparing the Amazon batteries side by side with well known batteries, the Amazon batteries were the best batteries for the money. This was not a testing laboratory but his methods appeared to be sound and real world."
Sarah,Dangerously bad product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were not good. I did easily get a refund, but wish they would've just worked. Some batteries had battery acid on them which got on me opening them, so had to throw those away immediately. Then another got so hot when I used it that I couldn't even remove it from the product it was in. These are actually dangerously bad."
V. Anderson,"Battery life is right for the price, warning and postive",4.0 out of 5 stars,"High output, not really. Not sure who makes them. They last better than Energizer Industrial batteries but not as well as regular Energizer batteries.So far no problems with leaks, but battery life is right for the price."
Al Glover,the most important thing to know is they work,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a photographer, guitar player and computer nerd (I'm at that awkward stage between geek and geezer), I have far too many devices that need triple a (AAA) batteries. Beyond these being reasonably priced and working, what else is there to say? hmmmmm . . . ok, I like that one end is differently colored than the other and that the + and - symbols are large enough to read . . . the soft pastel grey is good for the eyes when changing batteries in bright sunlight . . . so far, they fit every device I have that takes AAA batteries . . ."
Ben,Waste of money.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy these!! I purchased a pack of 36 AAA batteries because I have 5 battery run candles of various sizes that I like to have on sometimes. And I mean just 'some times'. Each take 3 batteries. I didn't start using them right away but I realized that almost the next time I turned on a candle the batteries would be dead without them hardly being used, just sitting in the candle. So I started to make a note, on the candle, of the date that I replaced with new batteries....to actually see how long they would last. I don't usually send in reviews but this time I have to say....don't waste your money on these batteries! At Christmas, I turned on the candle thats in the picture. Dead. According to the date I'd put on the bottom, I'd put in new batteries(straight from the sealed package) on 11/13/19. The other 3 dead batteries taped together I kept from another candle were dated 'installed 9/11/19 dead on 11/11/19'. The others are dead from previous candles. And these candles were hardly used. Before I realized how useless these batteries are, I had ordered another package of AA size......which are now just sitting in a box. What's the point of installing them in something when they have no life! Yes, the price is tempting.....but not worth it!"
Double D,Did not last like energizers,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these Sept 28, 2020 and I would definitely not buy again, unless I just happened to get a bad batch. I always test the batteries for full capacity before replacing old ones, and these were sub par... plus they do not last as long as energizer.They would probably be ok for an led light application but not for something that demands a heavy drain."
Samuel,DON’T FORGET THE BATTERIES,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good batteries. Probably as good if not slightly better. Definitely good considering the price of batteries these days. The batteries come in nice sturdy boxes and wrapped in packs of four, perfect count for most items. I never purchase an item on Amazon without adding batteries, it is very nice to have the option during purchases. Happy Amazoning"
Syde,You get what you paid for..,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for a pair of kid’s walkie talkies which required three AAA batteries. My 10 year old knows well to turn the walkies off when unused but after one day of, the batteries are dead. You will go through this pack of batteries quickly because they don’t hold their charge long enough. I’m glad I tried them but I won’t be reordering these tbh."
Beatriz,Long life and great packaging.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent value for your money, considering the longevity, and the amount of batteries you get. With other brands, I would have to replace the batteries on my roku remote every couple months, and with these, its already been a couple months and they are still going strong.I also appreciate the neat packaging they come in. It makes it easy for storing them and accessing them later."
Christopher B.,Slim profile makes for easier storage,5.0 out of 5 stars,So first things first I really like how these batteries were shipped to me. Instead of grouping all of the batteries into a cube they stacked them in a single file. What I mean by that is that the batteries were stacked like a CD and was slim which allowed me store the batteries in my DVD console area. These batteries are supposed to have a long shelf life time will tell if they have less than expected battery capacity later on I will make an update to this review. So far haven't had any issues with them.
HumanIcicle,"Best value, long lasting batteries",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying the AmazonBasics batteries of all sizes for awhile now and I'm very pleased with the performance of these batteries. I've used them for just about anything you can use batteries with and they last just as long as the big brands at half of the cost.They work great in my Xbox controllers, TV remotes, grill igniter, toys, smoke alarms, everything and the best thing is that they come in packaging that isn't a hassle to open. Simple cardboard packaging, no plastic shell to cut through and easy to store."
Linda,AA’s packaging came apart completely in Shipping,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries were shipped in small box. When I opened the box, the packaging had come apart & the batteries had been rolling all over inside the box, which was much bigger than the batteries package. I don’t know how it will affect the batteries in the long run. I have had a much better experience before with batteries when they were covered with small bubble pack, taped, & then put inside the box - no problem then."
lscs102,Just right,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like to buy batteries in large quantities because I've had so many 'explode' before I could use them. Eight was just the right amount, and these were the only ones I found in packages of that amount. My flashlight burns very brightly again! I have not had them long enough to judge how long they last, but I have confidence that they will do a good job!"
allthekngshorses,Don't waste your money!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wish I had done this before the return policy expired. We are replacing batteries in our remote EVERY WEEK, if not sooner. My husband gets a few uses in his infra-red measuring tape before (which he uses many times each day) and gets about 30-40 photos on his small digital camera before he needs to put new ones in!These really are the worst batteries we have ever used! Gonna stick with brand names-NOT AMAZON-from now on!"
GUTS!!,DO NOT BUY AMAZON BRANDED BATTERIES. I REPEAT. DO. NOT. BUY.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm telling you. I don't care if ""they"" have 47,000 5 star reviews. Don't buy them! they stink. stank. stunk!The worst. We've had AAA, AA, and C. half the time they don't work. I've had a few leak acid (stored properly) and it's always a gamble. you truly do get what you pay for in this case. stay as far away from the bezos brand batteries as you can. pay a few extra for the brand name. you'll thank me later."
Garrett H.,Great product for the price! I'm impressed.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life isn't as long as one would hope but they certainly do the trick for a few weeks. I purchased these because the prices at the store are ridiculous, so I decided to give these a try. I wouldn't compare them to the high end batteries because the price alone will give you a decent indication as to how long they will last. I would buy again when needed. I could see these as being great for kids toys as they aren't used as long as a remote might be."
hybroanglid,"Good batteries, great price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries seem to run just as long and as hard as the name brand batteries, but they cost quite a bit less. I love being able to buy so many at once so that I know I have them when I need them (like throughout the holidays). They were packed well, too. I don't think I'll waste my money on other batteries again."
Amazon Customer,Not worth it!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these Amazon AAA batteries to use in a variety of Xmas decorations which I'd put up a week before Tgiving. Initially, these Amazon batteries were working well and lasting a decent amount of time (about a week for each decoration) but I've had to replace them all in every dec THREE TIMES in the past two weeks. That is ridiculous. I ordered some Amazon D size batteries a couple of days ago; doubt they'll do much better. Have energizer and Rayovac batteries in other decorations and have only replaced them all ONE TIME since the week I b4 Tgiving when I put everything up! Energizer and Rayovac are the best batteries, PERIOD. Amazon, get your damn game on with your battery products!!"
Scott J. Fletcher,JUNK - These batteries are garbage,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy these batteries. I have purchased AA and AAA and they are all weak and do not last. They do not power anything. They are dead right out of the package. DO NOT waste your money. These should be zero stars.
JD Lewis,Reasonably good battery but some inconsistency,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are definitely good value for the money, however I have noticed issues: 1. I have had one battery in the lot ""dead"" and a couple have not lasted as long as I was expecting compared to the other brand names. Hence it loses a star at least. Otherwise most seem to be very good and because they are so much cheaper and I use them for candles, I'll likely order again."
Christine Aust,Caution: do not work on all items,1.0 out of 5 stars,These do not work in some items. We bought this to put in all of our Christmas animated toys and they would not work in any of them. We went out and bought some typical energizer batteries and they all worked just fine. At first we thought everything was broken but it turned out the connection on these batteries just is not as good or there’s something about the style that does not work in some things. They did work in our remote and our clock but again did not work and many other items. I would be hesitant to buy Especially since you cannot return them. We are out a good chunk of money since we bought such a big pack which is really disappointing.
Ngrab,Only come with a 1/4 charged left in them brand new,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had theses batteries for almost 3 weeks and had to change out my simple Roku remote twice now, the remote has no tv controls or voice options that would drain it. These batteries last about a week an half in a bottom line Roku remote. The Rayovac ones I was replacing with Amazon's AAA batteries last almost a year in the remote or more. My Mom bought these same batteries for a thermometer and each and every battery brand new put into the thermometer only shown to have a 1/4 charge of life left in it on the battery meter in thermometer. Changed them out to dollar store batteries and the life left in them was fully charged. So FYI Amazon brand Batteries come with only a 1/4 charge of bettery life in them. That's data from 144AAA Amazon batteries"
KinTrinity,Amazon batteries blew in a Amazon fire remote (2nd gen) destroying it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered the Amazon batteries to use in an Amazon fire remote (2nd gen) and in less than 24 hours the remote did not work. I pull the case to see if batteries are installed ok and battery dust is all over the remote and cover. Tried a different brand of battery in it and remote is gone. So now I have to buy a $29 remote because I used $0.61 worth on the manufacturers batteries. bought 36 for $10.99. They are all getting disposed of properly.
Danny,"Used or ""empty""",1.0 out of 5 stars,"They came loose in the box. I used office tape to tape them but only realized they were drained already. I used them and only after a while I came to question the quality when PC mouse was dead after only a week. I tried them all on my coffee electric frother and none will start the mini mixer. Maybe I got a returned item, HOWEVER WILL STAY AWAY. I wanted to return them when I saw they are loose in the box, but the price didn't worth the effort at that time. Next time I will return any open / unsealed item."
Loud Mic “Mike”,Not worth the cheap price,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received these batteries on July 22, 2019. Today is September 4, 2019. I know I didn’t install these batteries in my wall clock the day i got them, but for the sake of argument let’s say I did. Yesterday when i got home from work, the battery in the clock was dead. That is 21 days, or 3 weeks. This battery replaced one that had been in the same clock for well over a year."
Sarah Ellis,You get what you pay for,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Got sick of constantly running out of AAA batteries for my remote and fire stick so came here to buy in bulk. Was excited to find a large pack at this price. In the end it doesn't do much to save you money as these batteries die much faster than the name brand ones. They might be ok for something you don't use often, but for heavily used items I would spend the money on the name brand batteries, or prepare to be changing batteries ALOT"
Christine,Battery Disappointment,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am very disappointed in these batteries.I normally buy batteries made in China because I have so many flameless candles throughout my house because they are cheaper.But this time I decided to try Amazon AAA and AA and have to say that I will not purchase this brand again because the cheaper Chinese batteries last longer.
Rainer S.,Bad battery’s don’t work for me.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I put them in a Dish remote, and in 5 days they were dead. I feel ripped off from Amazon. And I’m a good customer."
Kyle B.,Good batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy the name brand batteries over the generics because they seem to last longer, but I decided to give AmazonBasics a shot. I was pretty impressed with how long these batteries last. My Roku remote eats batteries like a fat kid eats cake, and these last just as long or longer than the name brand (Duracell or Energizer)."
Freebird,Fantastic for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ever since Amazon started selling batteries, I have given up on the copper top and bunny brand. They last almost as long as the other brands, however for the price, you could essentially buy 3 packs for Amazon Basics for the price of 1 pack of brand name batteries. Very pleased with them and will continue to order them. Highly recommended!"
Madhuri,Horrible batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased 20 pack in June. Used first 3 for my newborn's toy. It stopped working in 10 days. I replaced batteries nd it worked for a couple of hours. Next 3 couldn't make it work. I assumed the toy was bad. Ordered a replacement and even that wouldn't work. I didnt consider that batteries could be bad, how could I? They were purchased 3 months ago and were stored properly. And how often do you see new batteries don't work? I see that never. At least with Duracell I never saw that. Finally it struck me. I replaced those batteries with my TV remote AAA batteries (of Duracell brand) and the toy started working. I called customer service and they refunded me for it but such hassle and bad experience!!!! I am amazed why would Amazon let their name get such a hit for batteries!!"
SeanM,Last A Long Time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a set of 7 LED candles at at 3 batteries per candle this was a great deal, these batteries last longer than other name brand batteries that cost much more and they cost much less. Don't buy batteries just because of the name buy the one that work and don't break the bank, these are the only batteries I'll buy from now on."
Kara,Works just as well as Energizer and Duracell!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So inexpensive for the quatity of batteries in the package! Before testing out the quality of the batteries, that price point made me already perfectly happy even if these turned out to be below average in performance. But what a wonderful surprise! They perform just as well as both Energizer and Duracell! Customer for life 100%"
Yusef farrell,Great price for durable batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was really hesitant about purchasing these after seeing the reviews about exploding batteries or them only lasting for a couple days. I did not experience this at all! These are going to last me awhile. I’ve used them on my fire stick remote and I’m still using the original first two pairs from the box who it 1-2 months later. This is a STEAL can’t beat the price.
Nic,Great batteries and a great price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My kids are battery hogs and it seems like everything they use requires triple A's, which of course I never seem to have enough of when I need them. This pack of 20 AAA batteries is a fantastic deal for the price. Compared to Kirkland and other major brands, these seem to be pretty comparable as far as battery life goes. These are powering my remote controls, wireless mouse and keyboard, multiple flashlights and electric toothbrushes. I have had no issues with any of these dying fast as of yet. I also really appreciated the box these came in. Makes storage very easy... no more searching around my junk drawer looking for loose batteries! I also bought these on a sale and with subscribe and save.... the price couldn't be beat! I plan to update this review if anything changes. So far though, I am extremely satisfied with the performance of these batteries."
Don,Batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are cheaper and they work. I don't know if they work as long as higher priced batteries - didn't test that. Lots of batteries go toward my wife's lighted/musical gadgets at different holidays and these are best for that. In a year when she pulls them out again the batteries are dead whether cheap or higher priced batteries.
Fern,Performed well.,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries lasted 2 months exactly(4/9/0-6/9/20) in my fire stick remote. I used Harbor Freight and they lasted from 6/9/20 to 7/24/20. Keep in mind that I paid $4 for 24 Harbor Freight and $7 for 20 Amazon. Sometimes you can get Harbor Freight for free with a cupon. Overall Im happy with my purchase. I hope these helps. I will try Duracell next and see.
J. Grosse,customer support!,1.0 out of 5 stars,After over a month of ownership of this product. I have found some batteries that just don't work. Finally I tested them all and 8 out of the whole box don't even work. I tried to find some support or and store owner to email and discuss this but after the return window is gone it seems all other support is gone too. Very dissappointed. Used to be able to find some support through Amazon but now it seems it's so buried I can't find it.
Take care of the earth it's our home 🏡,Good jobGreat value for the money not like it so far,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing I didn’t like that came packed well very well as impressed they didn’t go to my horse barn it’s a miracle I bet it to many different things I’ve shipped out they seem to work fine no leakage so far I hope the price doesn’t go up again otherwise I go back to wholesalers thank you Prime guarantee thank you sellerGood job
Lily,Don't last as long and leak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because usually Amazon products are better than cheaper brands, however these stink. They sat in a toy barely used, died, and leaked in it. The cheap manufacturer batteries the toy came with lasted 2 years, and didn't leak at all. I would liken these to dollar store brands. I will not buy again. Very disappointed."
PawPawRon,Seem To Be Lasting As Long As Duracell In Our Portable Radio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have not had the batteries that long to give a long term review but they do seem to be providing good and long service for a portable radio we are currently using them in. Overall, I believe they are a great value and will most likely continue purchasing the AmazonBasics brand for the other size batteries we use in our electronics."
adam dolin,I’ve always wondered really how much difference there is.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve always wondered how much nonsense goes into pricing AAA and AA batteries, and if there is really that much of a noticeable difference in length of use. After going through two huge packs of both with my small family of 3, in less than a week. I now know the answer. I won’t lie, we use our batteries. But one Duracell lasts infinitely longer than this whole package did."
"Floyd ""Al"" DeShazo",Amazon basic AAA Alkaline batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,When in ordered there batteries I was not sure what to expect. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I tested each and everyone one for voltage which was 1.61V and made in Indonesia. The last batteries I purchased were Energizer's Industrial grade which also carried the same 1.61 volts. The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased. I took advantage of the snail mail delivery I received a $5 Amazon credit which made this deal even better. From the reviews I've read I would highly recommend purchasing these batteries over any name brand for General use purposes as I'm not sure how they would stand up too I drain situations. But I will get back to you on that one with my next purchase.
Mark Muchow,They are cheap!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had to replace the batteries in my outdoor temperature about every 3 months, used to last a year with Duracell batteries. Will not buy again! You get what you pay for!"
TxDee779361,Junk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I went thru approx 24 in less than a month on my BP monitor. Thought monitor defaulty. Nope. Tried on a couple other gadgets. Remotes, motion sensor lights, etc. Failed within days!"
MBM,Amazon AAA batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The most important thing for me is that these batteries don't leak over time in the products, even under a variety of temperatures. I had batteries leaking and ruining electronics before, because the acid or whatever chemicals they used corroded the internals unknown to me. These also seem to last quite a while surprisingly at this price point. So I started using Amazon batteries in everything in all sizes."
Jeep Girl,There IS a reason they cost less,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These are no better then Rayovac batteries. We had high hopes based on the reviews. Lesson learned.....can’t always believe the reviews. Maybe some people have had good luck with Amazon batteries. We’ve tried several different sizes. They don’t last as long as the Duracell’s, they leak. I guess you get what you pay for. If you buy these batteries, I hope they work for you. I’m going back to Duracell."
wiredweird,"So far, so good",5.0 out of 5 stars,"They're new to me, so I can't weigh in on any of the long-term stuff (like longevity and leakage). But, this is a world where alkaline batteries are commodities, and this looks like a quite adequate commodity. If experience warrants a down-grade from my 5-star review, you'll see it here first.-- wiredweird"
UNyque B,Have Extras,2.0 out of 5 stars,"So I think my purpose was to have durable batteries. These died within a week in my remote control and my temperature reader. I have a battery tester so when I tried most were low or just plain dead. I did get a few good ones. I normally do not write negative post but with the weather the way it is, be stocked up."
Jen,Die after 3 days,2.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered a pack and they were defective and they sent replacement. Replacement is also defective. Never had this problem with their batteries. I put them in my led lights and they worked for about 3 days Wasted my money.
Let Me Help,Great value for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought these on my business account, for work, prior to this purchase and was so pleased. I couldn’t believe the value for the money! So, with kids and a husband who all go through batteries like hot cakes, I just knew I needed to order these for our home use too. Even if they don’t last as long as other brands (I haven’t literally tracked how they compare.. I’m just saying hypothetically) you get sooo many more for such a great price! Totally worth it!"
Yamin,Good value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries for my son’s toys.I tried dollar store batteries first but they did not last for more than 4 hours.I did not want to spend money on buying duracell batteries ,So I bought these to see.I will say these are good but not as good as duracell.These battery lasted twice compared to dollar store batteries so definetly worth the price."
Douglas W,Good batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've ordered several brands of rechargeable batteries off of Amazon with mixed results. Some of the brands I've ordered seem to maintain a charge while in use for longer than these batteries and some brands are garbage. The Amazon branded batteries have been consistent. They are always good. Some brands may be a little better but they will cost you more money so based on consistency and value these batteries deserve 5 stars.
Greg W,May get a bunch of batteries that are half drained.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what Amazon decided to do on these batteries but half of them are not strong enough to power a little handheld fan that only needs 1 AAA battery. I had to check multiple batteries to find one that had enough power to power my pocket fan. Works great for remotes since they don’t require that much power. Won’t be ordering Amazon Batteries anymore.
Troy A,Solid battery for a cheap price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought a pack of these cause they were cheaper than what I found at walmart. I thought what they hay, I'll give the generic amazon brand batteries a try.The batteries arrived in a cardboard box (like the batteries are held in the box itself), and are plastic wrapped in sets of 4. I slid the box into the battery drawer and it's been nice having the pack there.The plastic wrap is easy enough for an adult to get off, but I think my toddler would be challenged for a while to get batteries loose (I consider this a plus).The batteries are holding up fairly well, no duds that we've found so far. I've put them in various toys & devices around the home, and they seem to hold up as well as other name brands.Once I'm down to my last pack of 4, I'll be reordering more. I also ordered these in AAA, and I'll probably order them in the crazy toddler toy sizes if they make them."
Charlcie Cagle,Why I Love Amazon Basics!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm always the person who literally never has batteries of any size and I love that Amazon does this! They ship fast with prime and they are affordable, even in large quantities. They last as long as any of the more expensive name brands from what I can tell, too. My favorite part is it's affordable enough to allow me to keep various sizes stocked so that I don't have to try and remember to pick some up when I go to the store (which, let's face it, I DON'T ever remember) or have to make a special trip when a smoke detector or remote goes out (which again, I usually don't I j listen to to annoying beeping or get up to change channels). It's a small thing but I appreciate how it's simplified by busy life some!"
Barbara Turbin,They just don't last as long as the competitors.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They work, absolutely! And they look really cute and come packaged well. But, they just don't last very long.For example, I have two small strands of fairy lights that are battery dependent (pictured with AA battery for size comparison). Each strand needs 3 AA batteries. They have a timer allowing for 8 hours of use every day. When the ikeabrand batteries died (after being in use for 1 year), I replaced the batteries with these amazon basics batteries. The amazon basic batteries only lasted one month. That's an 11 month difference for the same amount of usage. Maybe I just got a bad batch. *shrugs* I am, and will always be, an amazon basics purchaser, but I'll go back to other battery brands once these run out."
A. Haag,"Great value, long lasting",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are long lasting (as far as I can tell! They haven’t died in my remote control or wireless keyboard and mouse, yet and I bought these several months ago)"
mkysay,So far so good,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these after reading the reviews. They came nicely packaged. No issues so far with the things we have been using them for (toys, remotes). Will update if we have any issues."
Sheri0604,Great batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE AMAZON BATTERIES! I keep stocked up on them for the kids toys. MUCH better then paying a ton of money for name brand batteries when these r just as good
Robinson,"Don't waste your money, dollar store has better quality batteries.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"For being an Amazon product I assumed it would be good quality, and bang for the buck. I was wrong, these batteries have poor power, and don't last but a quick minute.The batteries at our local Dollar Tree are 3X more powerful and long lasting.TV remotes are going through these batteries every 2-3 weeks.Definitely not worth the money, you're better off just going to your local dollar store."
Stephen,People need to read what the product is,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not sure why people are putting these batteries in a battery charger. Then when they malfunction they complain and then give them a poor review. These ARE NOT RECHARGABLE BATTERIES. These are normal batteries. If you would put expensive batteries in a charger that is this type the same thing will happen. Pay attention people. They work well. I use them in low drain devices such as my remotes and thermometers.
DML,Very short life,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used these batteries to power my Sentry safe locking mechanism. I went through 12 batteries in eight weeks. They ran out of power and leaked. The Duracells that I'm using now have been in the safe for two months, and they are working perfectly. The problem is not the safe..."
Shannon,Dangerous,1.0 out of 5 stars,I just had a really scary experience with these batteries. I bought a new remote and put a pair of these batteries in the remote and 10 minutes later i grabbed the remote and it was hot to the touch. When i took the batteries out they hurt my hand. After i put another brand of batteries in my remote everything was ok. I wonder how bad it could of been if i didn't notice this.
zachus,Not impressed but have their purpose,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a huge Amazon fan and I know the appeal here for most and me as well is the price but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and these do not last anything near the better more expensive batteries out that. If it's easy to change batteries then this is the way to go but if you have something it's difficult or a pain or you just don't want to the hassle I would suggest spending more and getting the upper brands, and by that I mean the more expensive, most expensive of the batteries out there, they really do last longer. It's a shame because you know they have the ability to make batteries last longer, all companies, and yet they don't just so we'll come back and buy more"
Bob G of Troy,Decent quality with the Amazon name,5.0 out of 5 stars,Low price means you can change the batteries without worrying about wasting money if they still have some life left in them. Doing ALL the remotes at one time avoids hassles with all the channel surfing and TV services we now are using regularly. A low powered remote screws up your program selections on the various services.
CalJan,They Work,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is right. I just got them and haven't seen how long they list. Judging from other reviews, I'll see whether I should add or subtract stars._______Now that I've had them and used them for awhile I will say that they start out weaker. The motion sensor doesn't detect any movement until you are quite close to them, and the light is dimmer."
GENE,SUPER GOOD PRICE BUT,5.0 out of 5 stars,MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY REALLY LAST AS A RETIRED ELECTRONIC TECH I WANTED TO SEE HOW GOOD THESE WERE AND DID A 24 HOUR DISCHARGE BENCH TEST AGAINST DURACELL AND RAYOVAC AND THEY ALL WERE WITHIN 5 PERCENT OF EACH OTHER IN CAPACITY NO. ONE WAS DURACEL AND THREE WAS RAYOVAC BUT BECAUSE OF PRICE TO CAPACITY RATING ( WALMART PRICE) NUMBER ONE WAS AMAZON
16copper,Just OK,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've used these batteries for awhile now and they were a decent value for the money. The last bulk pack I bought were all nearly dead when they arrived.
AHumphrey73,good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"they are just batteries, not much to write about them, it was a good price compared to stores, I recenbtly purchased a variety pack at Sams Club and I was super disappointed since the pack had 4 of the aaa (most commonly used) and 4 aa, the rest? 9v and sizes C and D, a fiasco. I was pleased with the Amazon pack,"
eMike,Your true AAA battery solution!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I just received these AAA Amazon Basic batteries, and although I immediately threw away and replaced the “still good” other batteries in one of my critical medical devices (a heavy user TENS Unit), only time will tell. BUT ... if my experience with the Amazon Basics AA batteries is any indication, I expect them to meet/exceed expectations! And the price? Packaging? Prompt delivery? All outstanding!"
Tina Mapes,Batteries are not good!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely disappointed as these Amazon batteries didn’t last even close to how long my Duracell and energizer batteries last. I bought them to use in an angel that lights up. Don’t waste your money or your time taken to order and now I have to return. I see that many people did give five stars, so, the only thing I can think of is, perhaps, I received a bad batch. I don’t know, but I am going back to my door style and or energizer batteries."
T,Hardly a good value,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Five dollars for eight batteries that seem little better than the name-brand four-packs sold at dollar stores. Why did I get them? Because I was clearly searching for “aaaa” batteries, not aaa, but these came prominately up in their search engine, combined with the confusion of pop-up advertising Amazon now interrupts my shopping cart with. Yes, still my fault overall, but a purchase should be easier instead of becoming a quest to filter out unwanted pitches."
Zhowze,Buy them you want regret it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon batteries never have I had a battery last as long as these have and they are the cheapest 100 batteries between $20-$25 you can’t buy leading brands for anywhere near that price and I’ve tested them in several different items remotes, toy cars, and flash lights etc. they out do and last up to twice as long as other brands thank you amazon for yet another amazing product!"
Jor El,Great Value. Just as good as Duracel!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a big sucker for name brands. But somethings are just really the same in quality. And this is that product. These Amazon batteries have been tested in my remotes, weather displays, clocks, flashlights, and all over my house. They are dependable and long lasting as Energizer or Duracel batteries. Kudos to Amazon ! Five Stars. Will buy more. Thank you for offering savings on all sizes of batteries."
Norman King,"Batteries, mmm... batteries?",4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are batteries, a good price, they are batteries, lots of them, they are batteries, beyond that not much else to say for them, did I mention they were batteries?"
QS,Great value on bulk batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are priced very well! Been using Amazon batteries for awhile now haven't had any issues with leaking batteries. They may not last as long as some of the competitors but for the price you pay for these i'm not too worried. Overall very please with performance/price combination for these.
David Brown,More than enough power!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We use a lot of portable electronics and we tried with so many of the inexpensive batteries to no avail. Each one would run out of life way before the expected end, and we'd end up buying more and not really saving any money in doing so. Lesson learned; you pay for what you get and these are certainly long-lasting batteries and we have yet to drain one yet!"
Case,Super happy with these!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Omg! I was skeptical because of the price on these being so good but the reviews pushed me to purchase!They work fine. I haven’t noticed failure in them like with other ‘cheap’ batteries. These are priced cheap but great quality. Good Job Amazon!As long as these batteries stay at the price I got them for I will never buy another brand!
FLPA14,Worst AAA batteries ever.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"AAA batteries: Used on my bed remote controls which usually work for more than a year. In fact I previous batteries lasted over two years (Another brand). However, these Batteries only worked for less than three months. I tried to replace with 4 new batteries, but they did not work. Tried 4 more and 4 more with same results so took 4 Duracell batteries from the other bed remote and they work. These aren’t returnable apparently so I am stuck with them. And I also bought AA batteries at same time. Hope they work. Never will order either of these batteries. They are not returnable and no number to call. First and last Amazon Prime disappointment. Renewal coming up. I will have to do some serious thinking before I decide to renew. Purchased less than 2 months ago."
Kindle Customer,buy these batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy only Amazon batteries. Seems that in the past twenty years, everything has changed to batteries. You can buy them at the dollar stores, but they only last about 73 seconds. You can buy them at the grocery if you skip a meal or two. You can do okay if you stock up when they're on sale at chain drugstores. Amazon's batteries, all sizes, are always fresh, just as good as any alkaline brand-name, and you really would be hard pressed to find a better price."
J. Smith,NOT easy to use packaging,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I discovered you can buy batteries in easy to use cardboard boxes rather than store display bubble packs that take forever (and tools) to extract the batteries. These are NOT the easy access batteries!!Although they came in a cardboard box, the batteries are bundled in groups that are wrapped in shrinkwrap. I had to spend a lot of time fighting the batteries out of the shrinkwrap. Almost the same amount of time as the store bubble packs.The chinese batteries are probably ok but not easy to get to. However, you can buy other batteries that come in easy to open cardboard boxes."
Michelle Dexter Logan ,Rip off price for 4 AAA get Amazon's 16 pk AAA,4.0 out of 5 stars,I typically go with the 16pk of Amazon AAA batteries because of the amount of Firestick remote controls in our house. Cost of the 4 pk was what I could afford this month. I'd definitely go with the 16pk rather than the 4 pk if possible.
K. Taylor,Work really well for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these in remotes and a LED flashlight. For my particular use, I think they work just great. There might be some longer lasting batteries out there if you read various reviews, but for the price, I think they last just the right amount of time. In my flashlight, it requires 3 batteries and I can have the light on for about 15-20 minutes at a time as I check cars while working a night security position. I can get a few weeks without needing to change them no problem."
Floyd Campbell,Strong Battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ordered these batteries on 10-16-18 and they have an expiration date of 02-2018. ALMOST TEN YEARS!Compared them in identical 3 cell new flashlights with the leading national brand.Turned both flashlights on and waited til they burned down.The Amazon brand burned three hours longer than the leading national brand.The Amazon brand was actually brighter most of the burning time than the leading national brand.I AM CONVINCED that 100 of these Amazon batteries are worth the $20 we paid for them.
C. G.,AmazonBasics Batteries are life!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been impressed with the performance and quality of AmazonBasics battery. Though the price point is pretty low, don't let that fool you - they are every bit as long-lasting and durable as the brand-named batteries on the market. In my opinion, there's no reason to spend more on a battery because of it being a name that you're familiar because I can tell you that my experience has been amazing. And honestly, I can't tell the difference between AmazonBasics batteries and other batteries that I've bought in the past that has cost me much, much more money!"
H. Turner,Shoddy shipping cost me 1/3 of my shipment,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Because of shoddy shipping container (without even one tiny piece of tape on the ends) I received my order in this condition with only 23 out of 36 batteries enclosed. Please never use this type of packaging again on my orders. Batteries are heavy and if given slack, can easily batter through the flimsy ends on this packaging. Apparently there was no usability testing on this packaging."
Berggie,Practical packaging against humidity if you ain't get it no wet intentionally.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it!!!! It's in paper box packaging not the plastic one. I can close it and keep it safe from getting rusty. I bought Duracell before and it was in the package we always see in Wal-Mart. Half way through it, all batteries got rusty and things, given my state is super humid. This packaging for those batteries should be a fix to my old problems."
Kimberly Johns,Perfect Triple A batteries.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love how they're packaged so neatly, so they can be stored neatly and not just thrown in a drawer. Were having a Halloween party and everything that needs batteries is triple a. This was the best deal for bulk batteries. So far weve used them in controllers and lights and weve had no problems!"
Barbara Vaughan,Bad batch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Usually theses are fine, but this batch was not. I should have returned them, but I was hoping it was just a few bad ones and then it was too late."
Scott Wasserman,"Great batteries for a great price, and packaged very nicely!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The value for these AAA batteries is amazing. In the past, I have always purchased my batteries from Costco but this is an even better deal. I love how it comes packaged in the cardboard box, allowing me to easily organize all of my Amazon batteries by just stacking the cardboard boxes on top of each other. The batteries have worked as I would expect them to."
Juan911411,Bets value for your money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried Bjs and Walmart and you cannot get this amount of batteries for the same price. They work great on toys just as great as Duracell.
VeeSee,These batteries are already dead when you buy them.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these batteries to power my labeler I just purchased in the same order. I put the 4 brand new batteries into the labeler. The screen on the labeler immediately flashed "" low battery! I thought it was a fluke and printed 4 labels. The next day I tried to print 1 label. The labeler turned off and would not print the previewed label shown on the screen. I changed the batteries, using 4 more ""new"" AAA batteries. Once again the labeler screen flashed ""low battery"" with the new, never-used before batteries. So I printed 1 label. I would not recommend buying these batteries."
Sara,Don’t recommend,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased in December and it is now September and realizing that these batteries leaked and killed my remote control.... so we all know that’s major! 😒I went to use the last few batteries (before I knew it ruined the remote control) & they didn’t work at all. I tried 6 and none worked on two different items. Will not buy again nor do I recommend.
Dean A Dobbs,"I use to be a manager at a battery store, and these will be what I continue to buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I worked at a battery and light bulb store as an associate and then manager, and while I am no electrical engineer, I would say that I know more than the average person when it comes to batteries. If you are looking for the longest lasting battery, go with lithium. But for alkaline and cheap, these will be my go to for AA/AAA. Great for things like remotes, more specifically I love these in my Fire TV remote. I highly recommend rechargeable AA NiMH over alkaline for the purpose of Xbox One controllers, but these do make a good back-up in a pinch!"
Maya,Don't last very long,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been trying to find batteries that will work well in a lantern. I have tried generic store brand, theseAmazonBasics, Duracell, Energizer lithium etc. So far these work about as long as the generic store brand.The longest working are the Energizer lithium, but none last very long. I think the lantern should have useda different size battery. I am sure these will work fine for some things, just not what I needed them for."
Luis Tobar,Good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these batteries for my aviation headset and they last the same as energizer batteries. However, these are way cheaper. Very good price and quality."
SeaPea,Do not buy for devices that draw a lot of power!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These WILL leak when used in devices that draw a lot of power.. ie., flash lights, kids toys and illuminated remotes. Considering that these items are the main reason people purchase bulk batteries, go with the better batteries in smaller packs for your purchase. Trust me. These aren't worth it."
Dino Smith,JUNK product. DO NOT BUY!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used this AA version of the product for a pair of wireless mic with 2 AA batteries per mic. It only lasted for less than a week (max usage per day is less than 1 hour); It put two AA batteries to a flashlight yesterday. I used the flashlight a few times to the washroom. Now it runs out of juice! The brand is a bad brand for batteries.
Christianna,Sometimes you need to pay the price for the name brand.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these becasue it was Christmas and I bough a lot of crap for my boys that inevitability would need batteries and I wanted to be prepared... the cost respectable for the amount of batteries I received however the battery life was disappointing. I mean my son doesn’t use his tv remote that much for batteries to last less than 2 weeks. I also used them in my PC mouse... that experiment lasted maybe 1 week and that’s with me turning the wireless mouse off when it wasn’t in use. I won’t be a return customer.
JN,"It took me 3 years to go through 36 batteries. That's pretty good, in my opinion!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are as good as you can get. I've had no trouble out of any I've had, and it took me 3 years to use up all that I ordered in 2017. So I would say they are first rate. I'll update this after I've used some of the new package, but I anticipate they'll meet my expectations."
Beverly K. Hogan,Batteries do not last very long,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I have used this battery, I have found I have to change them way more often than Duracell or Energizer (actually Ray-O-Vac possibly even lasts longer)"
Palma Janelle Nardozza,Excellent Choice!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to use with some stick-on touch lights, which use a lot of battery power, and function best as emergency lights. I’ve had the first set of batteries inside of those lights for several months and they are still going strong, even with use. I will definitely buy this brand of batteries again."
James P.,"Excellent performance, no leakage, long storage life and half the price of brand names!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these as a replacement for the nearly double in price of Duracell batteries. These last just as long as the Duracell batteries - a minute or two does not make a difference as my devices are on 24/7 - especially when these batteries are half the price! I have not had any leak, whether they were in their package or in any devices. The expiration dates on every shipment I've had so far have averaged 9 years with some 10 years from when I received them. This means they are fresh (recently made) and haven't been sitting around on a warehouse shelf for long. I like the green circular ""negative"" (-) indicator with the check mark (tick) on the side. Makes for quick installation in poor light. Excellent value and excellent performance!"
Joy,Won’t buy again.,2.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve purchased these for years and my last order of them died very fast. I had them in led string lights and they were on a timer- about two hours per day. They were dead within a week as opposed to buying them last year and they lasted three.
Matthew,Batteries work well,5.0 out of 5 stars,I used 9 right away for 3 tactical flashlights and compared them to a fourth flashlight with Duracell. The Duracells were unused but had been sitting around for a while so that may have played a role but the flashlights were brighter with these batteries.I might come back and change the review if the batteries wear out very fast but they definitely work well. And I like that they are broken down into 4 packs so I don't have to open all of them to use a few.
Web (.,Don't buy these Amazon batteries - all 36 were defective!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these AAA Amazon batteries due to good price, I figured Amazon would have decent stuff. EVERY ONE of these batteries was defective. I put them in remotes, in my Amazon fire stick remotes, flashlights, other electronics, and every time I did, they would last only 1-2 days and then go DEAD. If it was just one device, I'd say it was the device, but EVERY BATTERY in ANY device failed almost immediately! Normally Amazon is great, BUT THESE ARE DEFECTIVE... DON'T BUY THEM."
Denver's Mom,Used for Years. Good Buy. No Issues.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We've used these Amazon Basics batteries of various sizes for years now. We've used them in lots of things: remotes, Christmas lights, flashlights, clocks, etc. They've always all performed well with no issues. I like the way they come packaged in a box. It makes them not only easy to open but also easy to store them neatly and the sizes don't get mixed up. I definitely recommend them."
Ron T,Good deal for the money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"What I needed were AAA and AA Alkaline batteries to restock our wall-mount batteryholder, prior to the seasonal change for remotes, flashlights, and so on. These are fairlygood for the price and only had 1 weak battery in each pack. Again, for the price,not bad!! I'll buy them again."
Roy Rod,Excellent value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived super fast through prime and we're very well packaged. $0.27 per battery in this 36-pack is a great value even if these batteries are not at the top of the pile in regards to charge. Much better than Dollar General and other similar budget batteries you can find out there.
Luz O.,Solar rechargable batteries dont work,2.0 out of 5 stars,My solar ñights for outside my yard which i set it to make a row of lights for the night walkway well my new lights 2 out of 6 came with bad batteries thats why i purchased new batteries from amazon. Well only 2 of your natteries worked and did charged. The others have not worked.
Carol,It would be 5 star except the packaging,4.0 out of 5 stars,The packaging is the only problem. It comes plastic sealed in sets of 4 and you will have to cut with a knife between each one to get them out. Amazon needs to either package them more 'frustration free' or folks need to get used to having to cut them out of the little 4packs.
Teenie Nickel,Good batteries for my family needs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am impressed with the quality of these batteries. They last as long as expected in comparison to other brands. I am constantly needing good batteries for my children’s electronic toys and my husband’s various gadgets, so it is great that these come in a pack of twenty. This is a thrifty way to get quality batteries, especially when I go through so many in just a short amount of time. They are packaged in a small, cardboard box, which can be opened and closed. This is great for storage and accessibility. I would recommend these batteries for sure. They are exactly what I was looking for. I will most likely be purchasing these again very soon."
Bruce Hasanali,-Great price -Good battery life -Efficiently packaged and easy to store CON's,5.0 out of 5 stars,"PRO's:-Great price-Good battery life-Efficiently packaged and easy to storeCON's:-NoneOpinionated Ramblings:Batteries are a fairly straight forward item - you want them to last long, store well and cost as little as possible without compromising the first two points. Amazon knows the basics that everyone needs, and they can source these AAA batteries from someone who can build them best, price it as low as they fairly can, and get it shipped to me in two business days. Instead of paying a big markup to a ""brand"", Amazon cuts them out of the middle for me, and shares those savings. This is an efficient battery at a great price, and that is exactly what I'm looking for in a battery."
Don O,So far not bad for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Again, it is obvious that I purchased these batteries for the price. Many devices still use the AAA batteries and so far the batteries seem to be lasting reasonably long before replacement is required. I should be finding out about the shelf life pretty soon since several have been on the shelf for a while."
Tiance,Not bad & worth to buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I only need 2 batteries, I buy 8 packs. The 4 packs batteries in the bookstore near me gonna cost me $4.99. On Amazon, you only need to spend $6 to get 8 packs. Don't hesitate to buy it if you need it."
annette828,Works,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These actually work.I wanted something comparative to Energizer. And I was skeptical these might end up like cheap dollar store batteries. But I put it into my toddler’s battery-operated, electric toothbrush and it worked well!I have yet to test how long exactly this will last me."
Croughn,Terrible,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries suck and are no better then the dollar store, if you don’t wanna be changing batteries every month then don’t buy these"
J. Silberman,Good Value for lots of uses.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for remote controls and mini flash lights and everything else that needs AAA batteries. The price for the quantity is a no brainer. I can't remember the last time I didn't get a really good long run time for anything I've used the Amazon batteries.Hope that helps.
Teresa E Davis,Low Longevity,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries have only been lasting three days in my FireTV remote. We tried a name brand to see if maybe it was a remote issue and the remote is lasting fine with the name brand battery. We tested one of the brand new batteries out of the pack with our battery tester and it reads as LOW right out of the pack. Maybe we got a bad batch? I thought a 36 pack would last forever but now not so much.
Sk8brd,Remote control primary use,4.0 out of 5 stars,I typically use these for all the remotes in the house. I find sometimes that the longevity is not as expected on some of the remotes but this may be due to the overuse of scrolling through random series and movies on all the wonderful apps out there in cut the cord land due to pure boredom. Overall good value for money.
noni session,These batteries are AWFUL and DIE RAPIDLY,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Isnt the point of batteries to maintain a charge???the issue is these batteries do not keep a charge they run down rapidly. They do not have a steady charge. I got these for my flashlight. after the install the flashlight flickered, was quite dim when the shake the flashlight that seems to affect the battery charge or connection...what ever it is it is completely awful! for the most part the shaking cause the light to dim out and flicker.I know amazon is trying this new ""Amazon Pantry"" its a nice concept but thus far (i have tried a few different products they currently stock) and I just think the quality of the products they are choosing to stock are awful [across the board]"
Amazon Customer,This turtle could never keep up with the Energizer Bunny!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used these for multiple items but lifespan of these batteries for these LED motion sensor lights (pictured) is what proved they were subpart batteries. They are mounted at the top and bottom of my basement stairs and may turn on 2-4 times a day for 30 seconds at a time. I've had to replace the batteries 4 times in 3 months whereas regular energizers would last 3+ months. I wish Id returned them.
Tacen,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,They last way longer than two or four store bought batteries so I am set for a good long time with just this one purchase. When I finally use them all I will only buy from here. They are well worth the cost and compared to what I was paying for two or four I am saving money here.
Russell Tate,Good and cheap,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No pricey anti-shoplift packaging. No advertising cost. These are less expensive than name brands and, IMHO, just as good."
Looloo,Did not last 3.5-4 months with limited use.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these 4 months ago. I put 4 into a flashlight. Granted, it's a high beam/low beam flashlight. I used the flashlight maybe 8 - 10 times. They were toast tonight when I tried to use them walking my dog at night. I put the other 4 in and they are bright as they should be. I'm very unhappy with the value of these batteries. If 4 of them only last 3-4 months with limited use...this is not good. I won't be buying these again."
Andrea,👍🏻,5.0 out of 5 stars,We’ve been buying amazon brand batteries for years. Work well and last as long as name brand for a fraction of the price.
CW,Very happy,4.0 out of 5 stars,First time I've used these and they are much better than the ones I used to get from the dollar stores and last longer as well. Much cheaper and more for your money. I was going thru batteries like crazy just for a remote but not now. They even last longer than the Duracell that came with this remote. I couldn't believe that either but they do.
Bhanu,Avoid buying these,1.0 out of 5 stars,Most batteries did not last more than 2 hours of normal usage on walkie talkie radio. 2 of then worked just 7 days in a TV remote. I am not comparing them to Duracell but batteries are supposed to last much longer. These are not reliable... Do not recommend specially for emergency situations.--- update after 3 moths ---Batteries I did not use leaked damaging everything around it. If possible would take back 1 star it initially.
KB,Good batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well. Not a lot to say about AAA Alkaline Batteries. lol These work as good as any other brand I've bought, including name brands. Have only used 6 of the 36 pack so far, and the 6 are fine, so I assume the rest are fine as well. Came well packaged and timely with Prime. I would certainly recommend them (assuming the other 30 work). Good product so far. :)"
Little Gerald,"Decent battery, poor packaging",2.0 out of 5 stars,We used the Amazon basic for a few years. Mostly we are very satisfied. They do sometime seem to not last as long as previous orders. My problem was playing 36 pick up when I open the box and many of the AAA batteries were loose and rolling around in the box and then the floor. Perhaps little tape would have helped? Very frustrating to have them all out of the box and trying to go though the trouble of counting them and picking them off the floor.
Tundraguy,Not what they used to be - stay away,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When Amazon Basics alkaline batteries first came out, they were economical and performed just as well as brandname batteries. Sadly, this has changed the past few years. These batteries die VERY quickly and do not seem to have much of a charge anymore. Any savings for the consumer is GONE. Another sacrifice to the 'more profit' gods no doubt."
Amanda Eboli,They didn't work.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried all 8, none of them worked. I ended up having to go to the store so my 3 year old would be able to play with his new toy."
J,Batteries of Madagascar,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing in action. 20 batteries ordered, only 16 in the package. I like to imagine the other 4 batteries are on an adventure like the Penguins of Madagascar. Follow me boys, we’re going in hot!"
Mack,Great Value and Quick Delivery!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Streamlined packaging and value make these a great purchase—perfect for Christmas gadgets requiring lots of batteries!
Cakes by Geri,Love them!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't even know where to start...i have an autistic daughter who loves push button, flashy toy, so we run through batteries like crazy. i've have the rechargeable, (which are kind of a PITA), so those are long term. But just a qucick change out, this is perfect! You get a lot of batteries to have on hand, in a box, not PITA plastic bubble,and they are actually GOOD batteries, not like the cheap dollar store ones you think they might be. These are my new go-to's !! WTG Amazon!!"
Gilbert Rossignol,Great Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy a pack, put em in the junk drawer and always have fresh batteries ready to go. These batteries work great in my remote controls and in kids toys. Not having batteries on hand is a pain with so much going wireless these days and these won't break the bank to keep some on hand."
Jacqueline B,Quite disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these mainly for my Fire stick remote, and in 3 months, I have replaced the batteries 6 times. On a remote! I cannot imagine these batteries being useful on a more energy-heavy device. Unless I got a bad batch, I do not recommend nor do I plan to purchase again."
Brian M.,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of batteries for a low price. I couldn't detect any difference in battery life vs vs the big battery brands in my child's toys. They are definitely not the half-filled batteries you can find in the average dollar store though that's what the price would suggest. At .29 per AAA its difficult to find better unless you can catch one of the buy one get one free deals retailers sometimes do on batteries.
Pauline Ho,Doesn’t last at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchase these batteries but they don’t last at all. My blood pressure cuff normal goes through months before I need to change them but with these battery I have to change them consistently. Would not recommend.
Alyssa,A great bang for your buck!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are not the longest lasting batteries, but for the price, you can't beat it. We mainly use them for kids toys. We can't ever keep enough batteries in the house so buying them in bulk, not at retail store prices is a major plus! Just remember to shut the toys off and they last quite a while. Only batteries we will buy from now on."
ksqueen,they keep going and going,5.0 out of 5 stars,"when you buy these you can have a good feeling that you wont ran out and you will have batters for at least 3 to 4 months course it depends what you are using them for. I have a flash light that i use them for, and i can tell you that the the light is very bright."
Brandon Whipple,Lacking,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for rechargeable batteries and these can hp in the search. My fault asi should of read the description fully. With that said, these batteries to not last long, I’m having to replace every two weeks in the string LED lights I have hanging in my kiddos room. Other brands last last closer to 4-6 weeks. In my opinion, not worth it..."
MariLyn,Old batteries do not charge anything,1.0 out of 5 stars,None of the 2 packages of batteries worked. Old batteries or just not charged enough. Send replacement of FRESH not old battteries
Katie E,Stick to Energizer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"At first glance these seem like an insanely valuable purchase, but they die SUPER fast and I’m curious I they’re not responsible for the failure of one of my devices. As a DJ and tech enthusiast I go through a ton of batteries. Not impressed. I’ll stick to Energizer."
AxL,Must have and a great price for the amount you get,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for the amount of batteries you receive they are neatly packed. One of the batteries had some of the casing peeling off however but the others was fine. I will update about the durability of how long they last soon. Its a must have to keep in your house and a great price the the amount you get.
pdxdragonfly,AVOID! Never had so many fails and short life batteries!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to give Amazon's brand a try.... BIG MISTAKE! I have never had more batteries be dead out of the package as this, and the others have such a short life, similar to what other reviewers said... I will never buy these again!"
Mimi,Not sure about them yet...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are budget batteries so I really don’t expect much from them but since they have a 10-year shelf life we shall see. If they do as advertised, I’ll be buying more. Since they were Prime, they came in two days and the package wasn’t destroyed or anything. Hence the 4 stars."
Teresa Rose,Product fits the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have these on my automatic order. With all our electronics it never seems like we have enough. These are a great value for the length of use. I used to get inexpensive batteries from a local tool store. However, these last twice as long for only pennies more."
Sarah Kirchoff,Leaked... Would not recommend!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"All 4 of the batteries I placed in my graphing calculator leaked! The calculator was stored for a few months, but this should not have happened.A word to the wise: unlike Amazon devices (Kindle, Fire, etc) ""AmazonBasics"" brand is not actually made by Amazon. It's all outsourced to third party companies and Amazon has nothing to do with the engineering or testing. Some AmazonBasics things may be decent quality, but this is not one of them!Amazon, please find a new battery supplier, whoever made these is garbage!"
Liana,"Gives enough power to start a device, and then nothing more.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I threw away 2 rounds of 4 Amazon AAA batteries thinking I was crazy or I had a couple faulty in the bunch. These batteries let me weigh myself on my scale 2 times before dying, and died in about a minth, maybe less, on my remote.Now, I put the AAs that I ordered in bulk along with previously mentioned AAA, assuming they would be halfway decent at worst, in a PacMan game and it I let gives it enough power to turn them on, then turns off when I try to start the game. None of them work. I'm so disappointed."
JT,Low capacity,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are cheap (which is nice for things like remotes and such) but for any kind of device that uses more power these will die within 10 minutes. I used (2) of them in series for a laser pointer for pets and it not only started way dimmer than energizer or other named brands, it was completely off within 6 minutes.TL;DR if you want these for a remote or something very small get them! If you want them for toys or anything else that may need a little more power get something else."
Kindle Customer,Save your money folks.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst batteries I have ever used!! The date on them is 07/2027, so they aren't outdated. I put them in my computer mouse, they lasted 2 weeks, I replaced them...and they lasted less than 2 days!! Would never buy them, even if they are cheaper, initially. The Energizers, etc. may cost a little more up front, but last for months and months, making them more efficient cost wise!!"
DoZer,Not Worth The Savings,2.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries die significantly faster than the name brand batteries. Even using these Amazon batteries in an Amazon remote control. It is a significant difference and not worth the lower price. I will be sticking with the name brands from now on.
joseph,Battery Life Sucks,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As a fan of Amazon branded or labeled as ""amazon choice,"" I am VERY disappointed with these batteries... My children have walkie-talkies requiring 4 batteries and my sons stopped working with new batteries after the first use.... They quit so soon that I felt the walkie must be broken, but low and behold it came back to life with 4 new batteries. I have ordered a variety of amazon batteries in the past (be it AA or AAA or 9 volt) and I must say, I have run into the same problem before but gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt expecting them to sell a quality product. If you need a quick fix, proceed to buy but don't expect a subpar longevity."
JOHN C GRONBERG,Don’t Last,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries dont last at all for me and they are hardly used. I just purchased them in August was away for 4,weeks and went to turn on my candles yesterday and the batteries are dead in two candles. That is six batteries. I had same problem with double Aas in Florida and I take them out of remotes when I leave. Just unacceptable. I will go back to buying my batteries at Costco. These can’t be returned because I was away and return window is closed. Don’t understand these wonderful ratings."
Boopoopbdoop,Amazon brand is great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value and so convenient. If I go to the store and need something like this where I rarely buy it I almost ALWAYS forget. But with Amazon the second I think of it I order it and don't have to worry about forgetting it. And its on my doorstep within a few days. Love Amazon and Amazon brand items as well.
Holly,Great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these AAA & AA for my hubby since he has to use a headlight and handheld flashlights for his work, they last as long as the more expensive batteries. I get both sets of batteries on the subscribe and save once a month and save more money doing it this way . Great value and great batteries."
Bret,DEAD. DOES NOT LAST. DONT BUY.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just canceled my subscription to AA and AAA, which I’ve been receiving for more than a year now. WASTE OF MONEY. I am so tired of putting brand new batteries in and discovering they are NEAR DEAD. First I thought I got a bad batch but it’s EVERY batch."
Bill Kochersperger,Not worth the money. Dollar general batteries last longer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not real impressed. Bought these for simple candles on times and last less than a week and had to throw 8 out so far for being dead. Definitely got a bad batch or something. Doubt I'll buy these again
Kat,Great price for the quantity you get,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have 2 kids and they go through so many batteries for their toys. I tried using rechargeable ones but that just doesn’t work as great because it takes forever to recharge and kids can’t wait that long. These were great value for the quantity you get. They are decent and last quite awhile.
Rebecca,Don’t last very long,2.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries do not last very long. As an example: I use them in my electric toothbrush. I get a replacement head in the mail every 3 months. Other brands of batteries will last the entire 3 months in the toothbrush. These batteries last maybe 3-4 weeks in the toothbrush.
Akilla21,Not long lasting,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these batteries to feed some small round motion detection around in my home. The batteries does not seem to last long, either the devices require a strong mAh, or the motion is going off more frequently, and in turn the batteries do not last long. I get about 2 weeks then they need replacing."
SpartyAnimal,Value for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are nice because they have great longevity for the price. Batteries can be a little expensive, but these are quite affordable. I've bought these many times now for Xbox controllers, VR controllers and anything else I need AA or AAA batteries for."
Josh O,"They aren't the best, but they're the best for the money",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't found a better bang for the buck battery than these, and we go through quite a few of them here."
Devin R.,Great batteries! Long lasting & they handle a lot of drain!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for my baby's christmas toys! Let me tell you, I have a toddler that runs the toys around the clock and the batteries are *STILL going strong! Its insane to me! LOL! Great batteries and ill be purchasing more when I need to replace these."
Ashley Traurig,Good for price. But don't last long,3.0 out of 5 stars,so I thought it was a great idea to buy Amazon batteries because they are so much cheaper. They do work... But they do not last near as long as the name brands. They are nice for low battery usage items button things like my baby's bouncer they we can quickly. Still good for the value. But you basically go through twice as many. So it's probably about the same as buying the more expensive ones.
Matt K.,Quit overthinking it... they’re batteries FFS,5.0 out of 5 stars,A budget-friendly pack of batteries that work like any other brand. So far so good.
BobPT,Best bang for the buck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I find that these Amazon batteries last not quite as long as the two other major battery brands but dang near close. I get the AA, AAA, and 9-volt batteries and they are a fraction of the cost of the other 2 major brands. More mAh per penny spent."
Gable Young,None of the batteries worked,1.0 out of 5 stars,I honestly don't know why there are so many great reviews. None of the batteries in my pack worked or only worked for a day or two. I won't be ordering these again.
3pups+1kitten+1hub,Dont let the price fool you! These are great batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great batteries!! I bought them for my flashlight and also some low-drain devices in my home. The flashlight is now much brighter with these batteries than store-bought ones The box was packed snug as a bug too. No loose batteries rolling around (like a walmart order i made once) Update... Im a now repeat customer
Kindle Customer,AAA not AAAA,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this at 7:45 pm, and whomever delivered for Amazon threw it against my security door, and it bounced of to the front lawn. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. When ordering make sure you order the ones you need, I previously order AAA and received the AAAA, it appears it would be easy to mix them up. This seems to be a bargain, I would recommend this product highly."
George B. Johnston Jr.,Generally good battery but may not fit some cassettes.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The batteries are slightly larger in diameter than most AAA batteries. The fit TV remotes, bike lights, and the Maglite Solitaire, but are too large to fit the Attwood® - Portable Gray Light Kit 14190-7. When I inserted the cassette with difficult it peeled parts of the label off the battery."
Pat M,"Better, maybe best",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently decided to use rechargeable AA's to cut down on waste. Tried another brand first, they worked well on the first charge but some of them failed when it was time to recharge them. So back to the search. So far, these are better, they lasted as long or longer on the first charge and have all been recharged as needed. Now we keep using them to be sure of their longevity."
Amazon Customer,Great deal on batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price for batteries, work as good as name brand. Can really see no difference between the two. I will be buying again"
John Van Schoor,Questionable Life Span,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries seem to fail all too soon. I suspect they have not been tested by Amazon and are a bad buy. Very disappointing.
Chris A,Works great when they work.......,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 6/16/17: Purchased product again and they are working in the devices that they did not work in prior. Also, I believe the batteries are lasting longer than the batteries I purchased prior (maybe fresher... ?)When they work, they work great. I have a number of 'devices' that for whatever reason, they do not power up with these batteries. I can replace with a non AmazonBasics battery and it starts working. I do not see any difference in length, circumference,etc so not sure what is going on. With that said, they work great in this devices where there is not a compatibility problem."
Manny,You can't go wrong with these,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are definitely the best bang for your buck, great longevity! Look up project farm on YouTube where he tests many different batteries where these same amazon batteries beat a lot of the competitors and were right behind energizer."
Marc,Good batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hesitant about these at first because I've purchased a few other items from Amazon Basics and hadn't had the best experience. My opinion of the brand is: it works. These aren't the highest quality or frankly the best batteries. They work well and that's about it. The batteries are nice, they work, and they last. Not the best, but far from the worst. I do recommend these."
online shopper,Similar to  Name Brand batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries are a good value for the price. I have purchased Amazon brand batteries twice now. They last just as long as the name brand batteries sold in stores. I like the fact that Amazon has an ample supply/stock and I am able to purchase in bulk quanities.
DAAL,"Not major brand quality, but not expected to be.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thus far no issues with the batteries. Keep in mind these are not your major brand batteries, so don't have expectations of that. However for the price point I can't complain really. They do the jobs I have asked of them and have ordered more."
Connor K.,Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are comparable with the name brand guys! I really like their design and how they come packaged in 4s which make storage easy as you don't have random batteries rolling around the place. They come nicely packed to prevent damage.
Phil O.,These are okay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I think these are okay for certain products and work better in certain conditions more than others. I used them in under the cabinet lights and they did not last at all. I suspect in remotes and lower usage applications, they may last longer."
J. A. Mine,Very good value for the price paid!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries do not have the longevity of some name brand Alkaline AAA's, but they are good enough for my purposes. The Amazon brand AAA's do last longer than the Amazon AA's in my opinion. And they haven't leaked so far. This is my second box of 20."
Amazon Customer,Amazon brand batteries are horrible. Received all dead batteries and didn’t het my money back.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon basics batteries - I bought a 20 pack AAA, A large pack of AA and a pack of 8 9v batters. They say they have a shelf life of ten years. I bought then all in May 2019.I want to change all 6 of fire alarm batters some take 2-AA some take 9v.Every last battery was dead! TotAl waste of money. I had to back and buy new batteries. Amazon says they won’t take the return. This is poor customer service. You don’t use batteries right away all the time. I don’t plan to ever buy Amazon brand again."
Annesg,back to name brand,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Been buying these batteries for several years now. The average life span was 3 to 4 months, primarily in flameless candlesin my windows. Suddenly they don't last as long. Two of the last 8 batteries Ive used in a radio and was burned when batteries combusted when I was putting them in. Not worth the risk of fire or injury. Why did Amazon change something that was fine?"
Suzy Brown,3 out of 4 leaked first time charging,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying Amazon Basics rechargeable for years, no problems. But this batch (grey with yellow tops) were bad. I put a pack of 4 in the charging station and 3 out of four started hissing and leaked battery juice all over my charger. I've never had a problem with previous rechargeable batteries, so it's just this particular supply. Get a different maker!"
Ramon,Very poor longevity,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries do not last long at all.. I've used them for toys, remote controls, and other electronics. They last AT MOST 2-3 weeks.. I could not believe how frequently we had to change out the batteries on our Firetv remote.. I personally would not buy these again."
eris sulce,Great Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a father of two I am loving the amount of batteries I got for the price. I put them ony kids toys and if you have kids you know they leave the toys on and waste batteries, so this is a good buy because you get so many for a good price. The have worked great for our remote control as well."
Linda Silver,Leaked!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries leaked blue battery acid on two new flashlights after being in them for two months! Ruined my flashlights!! Do not buy these batteries. So surprised Amazon put their name on them. Normally I completely trust Amazon’s choices! And they are not returnable. Just have to discard them safely.
Stephen Heckman,Great Price poor value,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately this product doesn't hold up to description. Between AA, AAA & C cell batteries, I get less time than over the counter dollar store batteries. The price is a good point for what is advertised but the usage falls way below the value. Sorry to say none of these batteries will be purchased again"
Goeasy62,Terrible batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not last long at all, i changed batteries in my remote and had to change less then 2 weeks later, so once i use these up its back to duracell. I even checked them with a meter, 1.5v out of the package and 1.1 volt less then 2 weeks later, remotes stopped working until I put new batteries in."
David&dest,Sooo convenient!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Needed AAA for our TV remote. Was so handy to look and see if amazon had batteries. They came a LOT quicker than they ever would have if I went and got them at the store. Haha. Value seems great for the amount. Have to see how long they last?
LovelyAngelLady,"Good quality batteries, but affordable!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so happy that I came across these batteries. I usually buy them from the dollar store, but they've been out lately. My son usually needs to replace the batteries in his mouse weekly. It's been two weeks, and these batteries are still going. Will definitely be buying again."
Tucson Bob,Don't last very long,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first time purchasing batteries from Amazon. Very disappointed. Primarily purchased to use on a variety of remote controls.Batteries were normal at first, but now they just last two or three days and I have to replace them.Not sure whether I got a bad batch or what but having to change batteries that often is not good."
Henry Chang,Longevity is trash,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT buy these. The battery life is terrible. Would not even last a whole NIGHT in a LED night light/closet light. Last about at most 2 hours until it starts to dim down. End up buying brand name batteries and still on my first set. Has not dimmed down.
Jonathan Guerrero,Don't function across all devices,1.0 out of 5 stars,For some reason they don't work on all of my devices. It could be my Xbox controller or a Headlamp or anything commonly used at home. They just won't power it. They just work for some things lol amazon should check these and improve them.
Alex Soper,"As long as these are available, I will be loyal to the product!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let's face it... we are still in the battery age. They don't seem to be going away anytime soon. With a daughter that seemingly owns every toy in the world that requires batteries, these are the best match for them. The longevity is great. I have been and will continue to purchase all sized batteries of AmazonBasic. Very happy -- positive (charge) review :)"
Saima Usmani,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely great value for money. I cannot believe how much I got for so little $. They came very nicely packaged. The batteries were divided in to two packages so it’s very easy to store them. So far they are lasting a while. Hope they are just as great. I put them in my son’s walkie talkie which eats up quite a bit of battery and few days later the battery level is still full 🙌
Kemosabe,Need a Battery Charger w/ 110 volt,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Put 2 in my remote for tv; works good at the start. In two week; so weak, my remote quits working. thought maybe one of batteries was bad. So, I replaced with two more matteries. Same thing happened in two weeks. Will NOT buy these again!!!"
Bulent Guneyli,Questionable battery life,3.0 out of 5 stars,I used some of the batteries in my Xbox controller and it is out of battery in less than 2 weeks? I don't even play too much. Just couple of hours a week. Maybe those 2 batteries were bad. I hate to see the whole pack have less than normal battery life.
Shannon Sung,Last long time,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was hesitant to purchase non-brand item at first. But this actually works very well. Price is much cheaper than branded item. So now I only use Amazon brand battery for all my needs. I would definitely purchase again in the future.
David,It's a very good quality product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got many AAA batteries and I was so happy. Those batteries are of high quality. I haven't use them yet. Those batteries are standard product. I believe the quality is higher than the Dollar tree ones and I'm very happy about the price too. I was so supersized that the descriptions said it can last 10 years. However, no body will used it for 3 years i believe. It's a large quantity of AAA batteries"
electronic engineer,"Avoid at all costs this ""Best seller""",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries for my LED flash light that I use only at night. Previous batteries (also from Amazon) were good for 2-3 weeks. This set of batteries is good only for 3-4 days (repeated problem with these batteries from the current 36 set). Replaced the batteries in with Energizer batteries, no issues! DO NOT BUY these batteries. Waste of money!"
Nightowl86,Terrible,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t know why I didn’t read the reviews first, but these are really bad batteries, I bought them to use all over the house and even for small things like my roku remote control they didn’t even last a day. Two of them when I went to put them on stationary lights they batteries over heated SO FAST I dropped the light on the floor, and it was the batteries not the lights. Money wasted."
Paul Skopp,Quality of the batteries that Amazon would put their name on.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t know who makes these batteries for Amazon. After using them in flicker candles for only a few hours each they only lasted for a little over two weeks. Other batteries lasted for months.
Mama V,Just as good as the other 2 brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the price for this large package of AAA batteries. I just keep it in the entertainment center drawer for replacing remote batteries. I've found that the FireTV remote in particular is prone to having low batteries fairly often. I haven't noticed any difference in performance between the Amazon Basics brand batteries and the other top 2 brands.
Lauri Horn,Half were dead.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Half were dead. By the time I noticed it was a week after the thirty day return window. Won’t buy again.
Dad,Great to have as a just in case,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value and they store well too. I live in Florida so hurricane season is always fun, I stock up with these to use in the case of an emergency. they hold a charge and are ready to power our electronics when necessary. will buy again"
Laura B.,"Waste of money, do not buy",1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries die very quickly. They are a waste of money. I wish I could get my money back.
Tracy ,Comparable to name brand!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these along with a package on name brand batteries. So far they have lasted just as long! The price point is great for the value and I will be buying them again!
Robert Taylor,Not very good batteries,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these because almost everything I have purchased from Amazon Basics has been a good deal. These batteries are not a good deal. They don't last anywhere near as long as other types such as Kirkl***, Dura***, or Ever****.Take a pass on these."
mrsmel269,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy batteries at Sam's club for the value. I heard things about Amazon batteries and decided to try them out since I compared prices and they were cheaper for the same amount at Sam's. So far, they are working good for us and I will probably buy more when needed."
Beverly Morten,Most needed tool,5.0 out of 5 stars,"for my personal recorder, my remote for TV, my CD Portal Player. I have been paying to much money for batteries at Wal- marts and other places, and most of my hand held devices call for Batteries. Even my Smoke Dectector. Thanks for the nice price. and at the beginning of each year, all the batteries in the house are changed."
sobefreak13,Comparable to big name brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've always liked Amazon Basics for batteries. It's more cost effective than the stores and having a 10 year shelf life really makes this an attractive product that i can buy and not be worried about losing power. Highly recommend.
Andy Lambert,Great customer service,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately my batteries that came installed in the unit lasted 3 days. Supposed to be 10 years. I had to replace them with the batteries I was issued. They quit giving me a charge at all. They died a few days later as well.Could no longer get a reading. It became useless. Luckily, there was a generous option to take. My refund was issued before I even packed the box and I could keep them and still get a refund. No need to ship them back!"
Alex,Value far exceeds the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use these in a headlamp on a hard hat doing construction. These last just as long as the more expensive name brands. Not buying anything else anymore.
Jeremy B,Great value. Long lasting.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i Am a big fan of these Amazon Basics batteries. I use them for both home office and small appliance uses as well as for keyboards and mice at work. They last a long time and are a great value. I tend to use them all within a year of purchasing them, so I am not sure how long they would store."
mickey shake,These Batteries are the worse batteries I have bought.,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these batteries to use in a flash light. ( it takes 3 batteries ) first I was getting 1 or 2 at a time bad. Now I have starting to find a few of them leaking. At this point in 3 weeks I have had to discard 10 of the 36 I bought. I have other amazon batteries that work just fine. I can only say DO NOT BUY THE ORANGE AMAZON BATTERIES. I'm go to buy more batteries and I will not shy away from buying other amazon batteries as I said I have other batteries with the amazon name on them. With know problem with them at all.
booklover,Worst Batteried Ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,amazonbasics alkaline AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever purchased. They do not last more than a week or two & the power is nothing compared to a Name Brand batteries. I will Never buy amazon brand batteries again.
Angela,Just as good as other brands.,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are really great all around. Your getting just as good of batteries as other brands at a far more reasonable price. I have a son who loves his video games and leaves his remote controls on constantly. These are great to buy in bulk and they last.
bruce,Poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased these in 2018, expiration date on these batteries is 2028. They've been stored inside my home in conditioned air yet they now only last a few hours powering a wall clock."
Craig,These Batteries are Junk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought the price was too good to be true. Turns out it is. I put new batteries in a remote, did not work. I put two more in, that worked, but the TV showed the remote being at half. I put these batteries in my bose headset, the noise cancellation goes in and out after using for only an hour. I checked many batteries on a voltmeter, most were junk.There are many articles that these batteries are sourced from Indonesia, where their standards are sub par, the environmental impact is very huge. I do not think I have ever left a one star rating. I am worried for my electronics, I will discontinue using these batteries and recycle them properly. These batteries are cheap because they are cheap, please avoid."
Dale T. Sirkle,Used to be good but no longer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought Amazon basics AAA batteries in the past and they were good but the box that I have now (dated for 2029) die in a week in an indoor outdoor thermometer, TV remote control etc. I won't buy them anymore. Same problem with Amazon Basics AA batteries in use."
Nick,Why go anywhere else for batteries?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these batteries. They last just as long as other popular name brand batteries and they are so much cheaper!And Amazon is pretty on point with their delivery. Mine usually arrive next day. So, unless you are in dire need of some batteries RIGHT NOW you're best bet would be to order them from Amazon.They also come in bulk (like these are in a 36-pack). That way once you've ordered a box you know to order another when you start getting low.Use a lot of batteries? You can subscribe for a recurring order! That's just top notch."
George E. Goff & Better Half Michele,Best for Amazon Fire Stick,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My Amazon Fire Stick goes through 2-AAA batteries at quite a clip. These batteries require less changing - once a week over than every other day previously with other brands. However, you pay a lot more for the AmazonBasics brand over other brands. It is a catch 22 - if you don't want to be constantly switching out batteries you should go with these. Also, I find I get much better and longer usage from these batteries if I keep the battery plate off of the Fire Stick."
Albert L. Nelms,Great Value!,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Amazon Basic AAA battery works great. It doesn’t last as long as more expensive name brand batteries. I recommend using the Amazon batteries in devices which are easily accessible. Save the expensive batteries for hard to reach or hard to change items.
Steven,~~GREAT VALUE~~,5.0 out of 5 stars,"these work great, works just as long as name brand batteries. they do come with a plastic around them just a simple twist of the batteries and the plastic will open up.see pictures posted.I hope you found this review Helpful."
Aly,Inexpensive and works great,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great alternatives to brand name batteries. Much cheaper and work as good as others.
Stargazer,Great Value,4.0 out of 5 stars,First time user bought after reading reviews certainly worth the money. Now the test will be to see how long they last. Batteries are very expensive and use AAA batteries for many things so hopefully they will last me awhile.
Buyer of Things,"I heard these blow up, but not mine (so far)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently read that some of these blow up. As long as none of mine explode I will maintain my assertion that this is a 5-star product. If one (or more) DOES explode, well, we're likely looking at a demotion to 4 and maybe even 3 stars."
Rubi_G,Definitely not the best quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased these for small Wilkie talkies to use in the house for more of an intercom. They are not used a lot. The first day we tried them out Nd went to use it the next day and batteries were dead? We went through this pack within days. Next time it’s Duracell or energizer for me.
Diane Crispino,The shelf life does not last long,1.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these in January 2018 and only used 2 of them up until now. When I replaced the batteries in one of my devices they did not work. I then put them in a battery charger and all but one said the batteries were bad. The one that did not come up bad was fully charged. I just went out and bought Duracell; they guarantee theirs for 10 years in storage.
Regan,"Most economical batteries, not the longest longevity though",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price to longevity ratio, but doesn't last as long as the expensive brands."
Kate Douglas,Excellent product at a reasonable price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these for a remote control on a tv that is rarely used, but they're not the first Amazon batteries we've purchased and won't be the last. They're an excellent product at a reasonable price."
M to the Q,Really good product and packaging,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a high schoool math department chairperson, and we use a large number of these AAA batteries in our graphing calculators. These batteries have shown themselves to be equal to or surpass both the name brand batteries and Kirkland, Costco's brand, in performance and longevity, AND they're quite a bit cheaper than those others.We find that the their packaging in four packs in the the box to be most convenient, since we typically use them four at a time. It also helps with their storage by not having nearly 100 batteries ""on the loose"" once the box is opened. Finally, the plastic wrap on the four packs helps support the battery shelf life better than them being loose.Again, it's a really good product and packaging"
Anonymous,"Workable, but not the best for high drain devices",4.0 out of 5 stars,"They're ok. I'm not sure what scale is used to determine that these batteries are ""high performance"". They're good but if you have high drain devices, they don't last as long as say, the name brand known by their copper top."
Platypus,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work. They're cheap. They last long enough for me to go through the whole set in my wireless mouse.
Anna Nace ,Never going back to name brand batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great! The price is so much better than name brand batteries but the work just as well. I will always buy Amazon brand batteries from now on! They shipped quickly and at a much better price! So pleased. Never going back!
T. Smith,Leaky,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not only do these batteries die very quickly, but if stored for any length of time they will leak in your device or in your storage container.These were being used in flash lights mainly and they would last approximately 1 day at most. Using a different brand battery we are seeing at least 3 days use."
Sally P,Terrible product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible product, these batteries burnout in 2 weeks. I have a string of mini lights on a timer, 4 hours per evening. I have replaced this batteries 3 times in 6 weeks. I do not recommend this product."
Thekat0,They don't last,3.0 out of 5 stars,We purchased these in the beginning of 2019 and they lasted a long time. But then we just ordered more again in July 2020 and I'm almost out. They don't last long at ALL. I'm so disappointed that I now have to buy more of another brand
Wilma Litton,Poor lifespan....,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lifespan of a one day hit.... yeah the batteries are cheap but they deplete fast
Murph,These batteries are not supposed to be thrown in the trash!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are not supposed to be thrown in the trash!!! It shows the symbol on each battery that means don't throw in trash. Yet they're sold in bulk... So obviously they're getting thrown intro regular trash by most customers.
Cindy,Good product...defective packaging,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy amazon batteries because the price is always the best. However, only 4 stars because...the batteries were in a box and then inside of an amazon envelope. It was a good thing for the envelope, because the box came open during shipping. I’m a little concerned, but I think the batteries are ok, though."
Kim,Great Packaging and Value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a photographer, I can tell you that batteries are some of the most annoyingly packed products ever! But these were great! The packaging was slim and didn't take a lot of space. The batteries are still going (I put them in a camera flash) and they are trucking along!"
BirdNet9,Great batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"batteries are a great value and last as long as others. I use them in all of my electronic and remote controls. I will continue using these for all of my products. Highly recommend, great battery."
Cam and Ervy,It last a long time!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very affordable — I love amazon basics because of the quality but cheap price! It is as good as energizer, definitely a must have! It comes with 36 pack that will last you a long time. You have to have this just in case you need one."
Robin,Surprisingly long lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,I received these type batteries when I ordered my fire stick from Amazon. I was extremely impressed but wanted to go with a cheaper route. I tried different company's batteries but they did not last as long as I thought they should. I received these a while back and I'm so glad I took the chance.. they are long lasting and I will replace them when needed.
Maziar Aboualizadehbehbahani,Good price! Great quality!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries were perfect for my usage. I needed a total of 4 and a set of 4 as spare. So these perfectly matched to my need for a good price and awesome quality. Instead of buying a very big package from Costco, and still at some reasonable price."
Lilah,dead on arrival,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened these to replace the batteries in my Fire TV remote. Did not work at all. Found old Energizer batteries, they worked just fine. I do not recommend these at all."
Gia,"Great batteries, long lasting",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I only buy amazon batteries because you get the most bang for your buck. I’ve noticed they are always reasonably priced and they last a long time in terms of power. It may seem like a lot of money for an upfront cost, but they really do last a long time and you get more per dollar."
Billywonka,Great batteries.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These things, at this price are a bargain. I've bought other inexpensive batteries and they die or get weak with a few weeks, but these haven't wavered in power for months now. Very pleased. Amazon was super fast with delivery too."
Jaye,Dead on Arrival,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries are dead. They worked in nothing I tried. I also ordered ‘Duracells’, which came in the same delivery. They worked fine. The Amazon ones arrived in a package that appeared to have been re-taped. Of course I can’t know this. But I do know they were useless. Shame."
T is for Tech,Who buys batteries any where else?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really, I don't know that I would ever buy batteries anywhere else but Amazon.High quality, AMAZING value, and they work just as good as other regular brand batteries.I think over the past few years, between my wife and I - we've ordered hundreds of different types of Amazon Basics batteries. Mostly at Christmastime! Great!"
RTH,Very unstable batteries.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They have leaked and will barely last 3 months in a key board, which typically last a year or more. DONOT BUY!"
RJ,Low capacity batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We're all here for the same reason: these batteries are cheaper per unit than all other batteries. Turns out there's a reason for it: They have far less milliamp hours than other batteries. I haven't done a test, but these batteries seem to last half as long as others, if that (Energizer, Duracell). This is not an exaggeration. They have a notifiable and obvious lack of capacity"
Nikki Calkins,Bad batch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually love Amazon's batteries and gave had no issues in the past but this last order of AAAs are terrible. Maybe last 3 days in our remote. I don't know if there's such a thing as a ""bad batch"" but if so we got one!"
Jr,Surprisingly good.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was not sure about ordering generic brand batteries no matter the name on them. They work well to my surprise. So far they last the same amount as the other batteries from well known brands. Will be using is all holiday decor for sure.
Phil,No More Big Box Store Batteries for Us,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are good. No more crummy, leaking copper tops for us."
Mr. K,ALWAYS go with Amazon Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product quality and the best price, don't go cheaper, these are extemely quality batteries and I'll always suggest them. I blow through AAA''s fast for some reason, but much less fast when using these branded batteries."
RJ,Short Life!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Although these batteries are great value for the money but they don’t last long at all! They might be great for remote controls and clocks may be, but definitely not for toys or electronics require high power output!"
Bird Nerd,Work great and packaged smart as well.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Been using these and they last just as long as any Energizer or Duracell battery in my opinion. I also like how they come in a neat box, but separated into smaller packages of four, so I can keep a back-up pack in my pocket. I used to have to keep one of those opened boxes full of loose batteries on hand for back-up (or go through zip-lock bags to store them in), so this is much more practical."
David S. Courington,Unfortunate,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got these and attempted to use them in our fire remote controls. None of them had enough juice to even work the remote right out of the package. had to go buy Duracell at WalMart... I think it is odd though, these are the batteries that ship in the fire remotes and the first ones lasted about a year before needing to be replaced. These replacements did not work."
PDcali57,Defective?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seemed a good value for the price. Until adult son heard a buzzing, crackling sound coming from the batteries he had in his headset. I also hear the noise. Since unsure what would happen, disposed of any batteries left"
James Rasmussen,Good value. Unsure of origins or environmental impact,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good value. I’m concerned about the environmental impact from the manufacturing process of these batteries given the energy intensive nature of battery manufacturing process. Amazon is not transparent in this process.
Rigg,WARNING!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"JUNK!Bought these for use in a Fire TV Remote control. First 2 lasted 3 hours, 2nd set lasted a day and half......I know they're inexpensive but WTF??If I have to go through and voltage check every Battery I buy, what's the point of buying Amazon branded batteries??Spend the extra and buy Duracell...From Walmart..."
Larry Jorden Burton,Battery life expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saved some removed batteries. I'm going to sand the ends and reuse them. I question a potential conductivity issue, ie accessing the full charge of the battery. Are they coated? Still, a ""great value"", regardless.....* I cleaned the battery ends and greatly extended their life 5/8/20"
ANZicCO,So WEAK!,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries don't last very long! I have a sensor controlled night light that uses 3 AAA batteries and these were so worn by 2nd night that the bulb was dimmer than it was before I took the old batteries out. and replaced them with these. Do not waste your money...spend a bit more for batteries that actually last!
macmoon,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At $ .24 each the price is reasonable and these aaa batteries seem to last well in LED lights So far, I have not had a leaker in the 2 years that I have used them."
Nathaniel Ruby,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed some batteries, as my preferred rechargeables were having trouble holding a charge. These aren't rechargeable, but they were a great price and got here with overnight delivery. Great value thanks to Amazon"
Lucaschloe,"Good price, good performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good price comparing with other brand. Good performance. Good choice with families with kids. Most of toys need 3 or more batteries and have to exchange pretty often. We have two kids and tons of toys. So this can be our big saving. I’m very happy I always have spare batteries in the drawer. I still surprised when I saw the big amount of batteries even I ordered this by myself. Again very good price! And these batteries last long like other brands , I don’t feel difference."
ExploreColorado,"Can’t go wrong, great price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,You can’t beat the price!! They’re not the longest lasting battery but for price you can’t go wrong. If you need some batteries that are going to last you’re going to have to bite the bullet and buy some expensive lithium’s. I use these all the time and am very happy with the quality for the price
patty,Beware of the life span of theses battiers,5.0 out of 5 stars,The batteries seem to have a short life span. I use them in candles an they may last 30 days at 5 hrs a day
AlanAndMel,Long lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was very hesitant to go for a generic Amazon brand battery but it had such good reviews I thought I'd try it. I must say I'm surprised. Been in my mouse and keyboard for a couple of months already and still going strong. Great value for the price.
Chris,Great batteries at a great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these batteries for many different items. They come in 2 easy to store box’s(inside one shipping box) and are grouped in 5s. They hold a good charge. Price per battery is the best in this setting. Won’t need batteries for a while .
Marz,A so-so battery,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A So-so battery. It's a cross between a $1 battery you would buy in a local store and a Duracell or an Energizer. I got 4 months of use using these in a remote control.I like using Energizer's in my camera's and remote's. They do last a lot longer.Figured I would give it a try for the price. Good if your short on cash. Personally, I would rather spend the extra dollar and buy an Energizer pack. Less changing-out of my batteries."
terpsichorean,"Easy to get out of box, won't scatter everywhere",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Internet of Things... more like, ""Internet of Batteries!"" The more smart gear we get, the more batteries we blow through. When my wifi-enabled scale (!) pooped out after about 9 months on the ""factory"" batteries, I restocked it with the Amazon Basics. They ship in a compact, no-frills cardboard box... inside a larger Amazon shipping box. The cardboard box is easy to open... no screwing around with scissors and sharp plastic packaging. Then you can close the lid on them when done and not worry about them rolling everywhere. If you have shaky hands or poor eyesight, these are the ones to get."
Mohsin,Headphones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a pair of bose noice cancelling headphones that take a AAA battery. My wife has started to use them, and always forgets to turn off the headset. So now I just keep a huge stock. These work great for this."
Amazon Customer,Purchased because most of children's toys required,4.0 out of 5 stars,Am a bit disappointed in these batteries. They certainly didn't last long Christmas day!
Amazon Customer,Stay away,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst batteries ever! Idk how they are 4 stars at all. Stay away! This was your warning. Let’s put it this way: they’re worse than the Dollar Tree batteries. Just go buy those instead. You’re better off.These batteries will drain and not lost long. I’ve gone through an entire box in 1 year.... I. Comparison, the Dollar Tree batteries would last me ~2 years. How is this possible?"
Lee W,There when you need them,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work. Reasonably priced and good to have a batch of them at the ready.
Tom Throckmorton,"Stay away, junk",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry but these are junk. A little Thomas the Tank Engine toy was the intended use for these batteries, flip the switch and it goes around the track for as long as the batteries last. Well these couldn’t have lasted but 5 minutes before poor little Thomas was crawling at a snails pace. These batteries caused confusion and delay!"
Nancy C. Collins,Excellent product and awesome price savings!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband uses these batteries in his insulin pump. He was buying expensive brand name batteries because he thought they would last longer. I ordered these AmazonBasics for him and it is a great buy. As far as lasting, they last as long, if not longer, than the name brand batteries. I would say to anyone who is thinking of getting these batteries, you will not go wrong with them. Try them and see what you think. This is the battery we will be buying from now on."
Havehope,Cheap because they're a decade old,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought these were a great value but upon receiving these and other sizes I looked at the information printed on the batteries and they are 10 years old! Yes they work but for how long? They will need to be replaced sooner than newly made ones so the value just went way down, too bad."
Cindy Yu,Not working at all,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this order on 04/27/2020, replaced on a mini facial spa machine today, it is not working all, nothing wrong with my spa machine, it was working fine before I took out the old batteries, after I input these batteries on, it only shows the number on the spa screen and freeze. I took out some batteries from other monitor, input to the facial spa machine, it works fine.I am not able to return it, due to Covid-19, because I am a senior, do not drive, post office is not in walking distance. My $$ is gone.Will not recommend anyone to buy it, I learned a lesson this time."
Sgt. Scott,They haven't exploded!,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have had no problems with these batteries and I have test them thoroughly because of some of the reviews. I'm sure the stories are true but I can't see a problem with these. They last a long time for non Lithium and don't even get hot under heavy load. No complaints here a constant 1.5v is good for me!
Edward,Excellent batteries.,5.0 out of 5 stars,EdgeWardBest value around.AftertastesAfter looking through many reviews I decided to give these a try I have found the amazon basic batteries to be high in quality and peformance. I use the AA AND AAA SIZE everyday and have never Been let down.i would recommend this to anyone who is tired of paying a high price for a sub standard product Or who pays the low price fo a battery that will fail at the exact wrong time leaving you in the dark.:
K McDavid,Dissapointed in Whovillee.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not rechargeable .OVERPRICEDDISSAPOINTEDGOING TO BATTERIES PLUS NEXT TIME SO I CAN SEE AND TOUCH PRODUCT.WASTE OF TIME
Stephanie,Dissatisfied with longevity,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying Amazon basic batteries for several years,especially for holiday decor. Had always been happy with durability and cost compared to the brand names.This time they did not perform well at all,obviously the quality has gone down hill.I still had some older AA ones from last year that outlasted the AAA ones I just bought"
C the Mom Pete,"You get what you pay for, i guess",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The 1st batteries that I installed in a new product did not work. Thought maybe it was the product, but switched them out for a different group of 3 and the light worked. Would have been noce for all the batteries to function in the pack......"
Amazon Customer,Zero shelf life.  I bought 76 batteries and I could feel corrosion on all of the batteries.,1.0 out of 5 stars,No charge left. I bought two boxes of 36 each and I could feel corrosion on all of the batteries. I wasn't going to risk having to replace my remote when these exploded. I trusted the Amazon brand and thought it was quite the bargain. I have to pay postage. Amazon doesn't like shipping batteries and I can see why. I'm disabled. I don't have any transportation and why I shop by mail in the first place. I can't get my money back if I don't make the 30 day deadline. Arghhhh
Matthew and Derreth McDurfee,There is no better deal out there,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down the best deal on quality batteries in bulk. I have a recurring subscription to these batteries and will continue to use them as long as amazon sells them and keeps the price affordable. Thanks Amazon!!!
Andy May,Poor Value,1.0 out of 5 stars,In a head-to-head comparison in identical night lights these batteries last about half as long as Duracell. And they're shrink-wrapped so tight one needs a sharp object just to open the package. Never again.
Bookbean,The only batteries I'll buy now,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I started buying Amazon batteries a couple of years ago and have been so pleased with them that I don't buy batteries at the store any more. So easy to just order a pack of 20 of these, which will last me and my family several months. I don't notice any diminishment of performance between them and the ""big name"" batteries."
TJ Hammer,Good batteries and a good price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m not a battery expert but I do use a lot of batteries. These batteries work well and I’m comfortable with the pricing. We tend to buy them in bulk so that we never run out. I would recommend these batteries. For more detailed information check the other reviews. A few get very specific on performance.
Betty K.,Low lumen.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They are VERY low lights. Not happy with these at all. Need another method to attach to cabinets. Mine have a backer board type texture that don’t allow much to stick to them. So, I resorted to glue—industrial strength."
Scott Abbott,Longevity is Awesome on These Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can't beat the value for the money. I performed an experiment with these on an LED spider, I've got on my house for Halloween. I put the batteries in, and leave it on, and keep track, of how long the batteries last. A competitor, that we all know and see in the stores everyday, last for about 32 hours, and then died. These batteries are now going on 54 hours, and still lit, albeit dim, but nonetheless, still lit up. These will be my go to batteries, from now on."
Cameron S,AmazonBasics batteries do it again!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've lost count of the packs of these batteries I've purchased at this point. I buy them because they are reliable and affordable! They work great in remotes, toys, my guitar pedals and instruments with active electronics etc. I'm sure I'll be purchasing many more packs of these batteries!"
K. McCown,Size does matter!,1.0 out of 5 stars,These candles are SO SMALL. Shame on me for not measuring out the size of the candle on my windows.I wanted them for the windows of my 2 story house for Christmas. I listened to the other reviews that had used them this way with success. Big mistake. They are small & look small in the windows & the light they give off is not substantial enough to make an impact from the street. I do not recommend them for this use.The profit was nicely packaged & worked fine. I think using them inside for decor would be ok.
marsumm,Last Long,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries last long and they are a great value for the cost.
Sci-Fi Guy,I got duds,1.0 out of 5 stars,"At least some of the batteries were DOA. I didn't start using them till about 1 month after receiving them only to find in testing (on a good flashlight in which Duracell and some rechargeable batteries worked perfectly) at least some were dead. And yeah, I was careful to install them the right way."
Kim,Not a good idea to buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just opened a set of 4 and they didn't work. Before today, they didn't last beyond a month. Do not buy Amazon batteries, buy Duracell so you can have batteries that work."
PRPITT,They don't last long,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I use these batteries in LED lights for closets. It hasn't even been 30 days since we bought them and they hold a charge about 3 hours of occasional coming on and off. The lights themselves were tested to make sure it was the batteries, and it was in fact the batteries. Great price because they just don't work well. I put a full charge on them and after coming on and off about every 30 mins they are dying out after 3 hours. Regular batteries and other rechargeable s last at least 6 weeks in these same LED lights. These never did last very long even when brand new."
Elizabeth Scott,"SHORT LIFE SPAN, DO NOT BUY!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries literally have the worlds shortest lifespan. DO NOT BUY THEM if you want them to work for longer than one minute. I can’t even return these horrible batteries because I didn’t try to use them until recently, and it’s unfortunately past the return date. So while I was trying to save money by not buying Duracell, I ended up buying Duracell anyway and donating $20 to Amazon. Buyer beware!"
Ashley,Batteries Leaking Acid,1.0 out of 5 stars,"awful batteries! I bought these hoping that they would be a great buy and instead regret the purchase immensely. I have a star projector for my infant son and used the batteries in it. After only ONE day the projector wouldn’t turn on anymore. When I opened the hatch it turned out that two batteries had leaked battery acid inside. I wasn’t impressed by the life span of the batteries but what do expect for that price, however the battery acid leaking is unacceptable. I will not use the batteries in anything else with the fear it will ruin another device or worse get on my son..."
Melissa,Don't try to use these in kids toys!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"We got these to run all those little toys that our little boys have (Thomas the trains and magic track cars etc) and the batteries barely last a day! I have gotten longer-lasting batteries from Dollar Tree! I am really disappointed in these! The AA's are not much better.If you just need to power tv remotes they will work for a month or so, but I suggest spending a little more and getting better batteries!"
Jessica T,"Do not last, not worth it",1.0 out of 5 stars,"We have burned through these batteries because they do not last at all. The batteries we previously had in our remote lasted for over a year. We have changed these batteries 2x in 3 months. And in baby toys, they have lasted a week maybe. Do not recommend at all."
Krista&Bill,NEVER again,1.0 out of 5 stars,I am so disappoined with these batteries. I thought it was going to be a great value for the money and to try a new brand. I wont do that again. They do not hold a charge long and a few did not work at all. Very disappointed
D. OGLEE,Great Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these for remotes and keyboards and such. They are great. I can't speak to how long they would last if under the stress of high energy toys but I would start with them before paying a ton more for these sizes.
Mr. Helpful,Affordable and Somehow does the Job,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most affordable in amazon market so far. I use this in tv remote controls, numerous toys of my children, soap dispenser etc. so far, it does not drain fast and does what a battery should do.Do I recommend this? As of this moment, yes!"
J. Price,Big box of batteries,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: these batteries don't last. They burn out quickly.I like this product. Everything runs on AAA these days so you can never have too many. Within the box, they come in smaller wrapped packages of 5 each so it makes it easy to put them in different places in the house to have when needed."
avarek,"Bought 36 batteries, only got 35.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decided to try these and see how they compare. I could clearly see when I opened the box that one of the 3 “12-packs” is one battery short. Not worth returning because I’m lazy but worth mentioning for other buyers.
Mrc,Great deal on some durable batteries.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Huge pack of batteries for an affordable price. Its a good idea to have extra batteries around the house for when needed. I have a pair in a remote and i havent had the need to replace so the durability is ok enough for regular use
John,Maybe I got a bad batch,1.0 out of 5 stars,I usually really like Amazon branded products but must have gotten a bad batch of batteries. All of mine arrived dead. They would hardly power a TV remote if anything at all. I tested several batteries straight from the plastic on two different battery testers and most (90% or more) tested bad.
Rick,Good price,4.0 out of 5 stars,I havent used them for very long so far and its hard to rate on longevity. But the half dozen or so that I have installed are working it seems as well as more expensive name brands so I wouldnt be afraid to buy again.
Kcuret,Decent longevity for lower power needs,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are decent batteries and last an average amount of time for lower powered items. Good for remotes and fairy lights and a good price. Would buy again for those types of items but not for items requiring more power.
Marina Lee,Top buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Third time purchasing and will continue to purchase for long time. I feel I sort of run thru them quickly, but have a toddler with a lot of high drain toys that are left on sometimes. Nice to have a few back ups on hand. Always comes fast and professional packaging. Thank you"
Orphynanni,They work.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know what else to say. They power an arsenal of electronic toys and remote controls very nicely. The seem to be comparable to the name brands though I've never tested them side by side. I just know that I haven't had to replace batteries any more often since switching to these. Best of all, the price can't be beat, and they get delivered to my door. Solid product."
MariamG,We Buy All Of Our Batteries From Amazon.......,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these AmazonBasics AAA Batteries (Pack of 20) via Subscribe and Save for the added savings. We normally buy rechargeables but sometimes you just need some inexpensive batteries for gifts or what have you...This product is made in Indonesia. Delivered as pictured and described. Size-wise, these fit into devices as they should. So far they seem comparable to others we've used but for the price, my expectations were not set too high.Good value for the 20 pack at under seven dollars before tax. Will purchase again and would recommend to others. Smile. Hope this helps."
Alex Sanchez,One you go to Amazon Basics you never go back,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This batteries last a long time in my remote controls, the are priced better than the name branded one and they perform just as good or maybe even better. They have a nice weight to them, you can tell its a good battery."
Long term customer,Batteries run out extremely quickly. Very Poor Product,1.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries run out extremely quickly. Very Poor Product
William S. Holland,Very Short Useful Life,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries did not last long in all applications. For example, the batteries only lasted about 3-4 weeks in a television remote. I used the batteries up but won't buy them again.I was hopeful for value but very disappointed in the end."
Hannah,No longevity whatsoever,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I hardly ever leave reviews but after using these batteries on several items in my house, these are by far the worst batteries I've had the displeasure of using. They end up dead in what seems like 24 hours or less. I had a lamp with these batteries and left it on for 4 hours for three days each. By the end of the third day the lamp was dead. And this has been repeating with the other items I'm using the batteries in. Will not be repurchasing, please beware!"
THE Customer,Brand name batteries are stupid expensive,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries are goofy expensive for the name brands. The Amazon Basics are a better price but the trade off is shorter lifespan. Overall, still a decent deal."
Ryan O.,They are pretty good for what they cost?,4.0 out of 5 stars,The reviews had is very hesitant about buying these low priced budget batteries. We use a lot of AAA's in the household mainly in high powered led flash lights. Have been using Energizer and the occasional jobsmart brand from tsc. I will not say these amazon batteries are the greatest battery out there. They did however last surprisingly longer than expected. They lasted about 3/4 the time that the Energizers do in lights and they are still going strong in my kids toys. They are worth what you pay for them but if you want to go longer without having to swap out batteries you should go with Energizers or Duracell. I will be trying the aa batteries next.
J. C. Evans,About 1/3 of these are bad.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"About 1/3 of these don't work at all - I've never had batteries do that. Also, does not seem to last anywhere near as long as name brands. Maybe just got unlucky, but not buying these again.Also not easy to open! They come in plastic-wrapped 4 packs that takes a sharp object to open."
Brusky 1995,POOR POWER LASTING. Not up to snuff with major brand batteries.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor lasting power.I use exclusively with my cordless headphones which draw minimal power.If I get 3 days out of these I consider myself lucky.
mprii,Battery values add up,5.0 out of 5 stars,These AAA batteries work and last as long as the duracells that I normally purchase. However there is great value in buying these Amazon basic batteries. For the price I paid for this pack of basic batteries and my local drugstore I would have gotten only four batteries.
The Editor,No loose batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are good batteries at a good price. They stand out because they come plastic-wrapped in packages of four. This is brilliant. Instead of dozens of batteries rolling around in a plastic blister pack or loose in a drawer, they're in packs that can be stacked anywhere"
Maryalice,Amazon surprisingly disappoints,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Long time Amazon customer but their batteries don't last. Won't be buying them again. It's not the first time. Size AAA and AA had similar, poor results. Buyer beware."
Kenneth Depree,"Good, Reliable Battery For The Price",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used AmazonBasics batteries before and know they are a good value. When at home I normally use rechargeables, but because I was leaving on a trip to visit various family members and would need batteries, rather than taking batteries with me I ordered these for delivery to my first stop. They are doing the job I expected and any not needed immediately will go home with me and put to good use."
FlamingoLady,They don’t last.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I like most of Amazon’s brands but these batteries are a complete bust. I purchased for led candles on 4 hour timers. The batteries lasted less that a week before the lights went dim. The AA seemed to do much better, as those were for a wreath lit 24/7 for several weeks. Better to stick with other brands."
ScottieW,"Good thing they come in large batches, because they don't last",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The batteries are handy to have, especially because they come in large packs; however, they are pretty pitiful with respect to longevity. Should have expected this based on the price, but one can hope."
Corie and Cristopher,none of them work.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."
Roryson,"All batteries died after sitting 15 months, they do not last 10 years on shelf",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 36 of these for undercabinet lights. I have never turned them on I just wanted the availability to do so. Every single one of the lights does not work after 15 months of install NEVER using them. As others have states if you use them right away they are fine, still half the battery length. But do NOT try to store these."
D. Levine,Junky Batteries don’t work,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these in July, 2020. Went to use a couple in February, 2021 and they were no good. Went to the store and bought some others which worked fine. Hugely disappointed. Don’t waste your money."
Gina,AAA Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these batteries after my television remotes died, and i was running around trying to find batteries. I usually keep extras in my home, but i could not, so ordering in this little bulk iis best for me."
Smedley Butler,"Good value, excellent presentation",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good value. Very fast delivery!In my experience the AAA's that I use last a long time in my devices that take them. This group should last a long time.They arrived packed into a tidy cardboard sleeve, all in a row so that you can dispense one battery at a time."
Zilla,Highly recommend!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m really impressed, these batteries work just as well, and maybe better than anything you can purchase. These are much less expensive with the same great quality of the best out there, highly recommend."
Arijit Roy,Amazon basic is always value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn’t compare these with Duracell longevity, thats practically isn't fair. For the price I would say these are great and last long enough compared to any other batteries and are almost 1/2 of the cost of similar competitor brands."
Product buyer,It’s a bargain and great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a bargain and great product like most of Amazon basics items. People always cry for small business. I hate them as the steal from customers, their employees and hardly pay any taxes. My local store asked me $4 for 4 batteries."
Eric Magoo,Batteries for Dayzz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheaper than other options. Will they last longer than more name-brand batteries, not sure, but I have so many I can just replace them. I have also started using rechargeable batteries, so these will become for emergencies."
Chelsea BRR,Skip,1.0 out of 5 stars,Thought these would be a good value for money but man was I wrong. These last less than half the amount of time of a Duracell or Energizer or any other type of battery that I normally get at Target. Not worth the hassle. Just skip these. Do not recommend.
dewdad,Inexpensive,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't see a big difference between these inexpensive batteries and the ""name brand"" ones I use since I mostly use them for electronics like remote controls and other applications where high power demands are not needed."
Ken W.,Why pay double?,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are great and less than half the price of Duracell. BTW I have had many Duracells leak when left in a device for a long time. These are no more inclined to leak than any others.
Mr.J,Good batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to buy this because it is cheap. However, before buying I read the reviews and most of them have reported there are leaks. But I did not get into any sort of trouble with these batteries. So far it works great, no issues."
Irongohon,Thanks again amazon!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I alway love Amazon brand, of course they are not like name brands battery, but there alot cheaper then them. I used this battery for my car remote, it last me close to 2 months+, I'm happy with it.."
Chas,Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good with these. Unlike the junk ray o vac and some duracell that have self destructed in my items like remotes and flashlights ruining them, these have been great. I will buy more ."
Angel44fire,Always buy your batterys from Amazon!,5.0 out of 5 stars,The value for the money is so much better than any store you can buy from! Even Costco batteries are more expensive.These batteries last as long as any other battery I use and they are a great value!
Gwen,All dead batteries - thanks :(,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ridiculous waste of money and very sad bc I really needed batteries for my reptiles terrarium lighting. None of them worked. I tried them in all different capacities to make sure it was the batteries that was not working. What’s the point of buying a whole bunch of brand new dead batteries!!!? :( very upset.
Charlette A. P. Kealoha,It works very well!,4.0 out of 5 stars,It fits the budget and funny how Amazon has the rabbit brand affordable?! Of course you get more with the Amazon brand for we did notice how much the triple a's is needed though out the house. Like under the counter's press lights for which we have a lot of.
C. Eckard,"Amazon Basics 36 Pack AAA High-Performance Alkaline Batteries, 10-Year Shelf Life",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon batteries are the only ones that I buy and have bought for many years they last just as long as the more expensive ones and you get more for your moneyI highly recommend Amazon batteries
HungryCraftyKelsey,Nice value!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter has tons of toys that require batteries, as well as controllers for the switch. The longevity isn't great, but it isnt horrible. The value of the money for the batteries is great."
K. Fernau,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I am very pleased with my purchase. I gave longevity 5 stars despite not having them long yet since I left a flashlight on for most of the night to test one and it continued to work without any reduction in power. I would recommend them. Shelf life remains to be discovered.
Ebay,Great deal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"compare to price vs quality, i couldn't see any better deal than this. i used to use brand name batteries but this one do the same. I will now continue to get these for all sizes. Save your money, and get these."
Multi-grain bagels,So far very good for the price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these in time for Christmas presents I knew would need batteries. The 36 count has helped me keep up with toys that have long been holding on to dead batteries. And has brought back to life. It was fun switching them out and somewhat satisfying. They come in a flat square package with batteries stored in packs of 4 so 9 packs in total.That being said I'll see how long these hold up and try to update.
Stephanie M.,Awesome Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value on batteries! I don't know about longevity or remote control because my focus is on other priorities, but there isn't anything I distinctly didn't like about these batteries so I assume that means they do well in those two criteria. I bought these for their price and I've been happy with them."
Meraj,Battery life comparable to name brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,With Tons of kids toys We blow through batteries like a Tesla on a road trip! These AB aaa batteries have as much life as their bunny and copper top counterparts. Can’t comment on shelf life for obvious reasons.
Ula Parra,Short life span,1.0 out of 5 stars,The batteries have the shortest life of any battery I have ever purchased even the dollar store batteries last longer I brought them because they seemed like a great deal however when I stared to replace them daily in my sons dinosaur toy I realized they aren’t any good
Beantown Jim,Basically OK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I found that you can't skimp on batteries. Get the best battery for that particular size unless changing them is a breeze and you can afford down time. The batteries in question here are ok, but the absolute top brands' alkaline products seem to be better."
Pete,Needs the larger washers that come with the 3 pack.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This was our second order for these lights. We first ordered the 3 pack about a month ago, and have been happy with the installation and performance in both indoor and outdoor locations. We liked them enough to order more. We just took delivery of a 6 pack of the lights, and find that they came with smaller diameter washers, resulting in less adhesive area, and consequently they will not stay put. They keep falling off the wall or bottom side of the shelf. I'll keep them, assuming the lights themselves are trouble free, and will either try to find a larger diameter washer, and use some double sided tape, or put a higher strength adhesive on the smaller washers provided."
Ahmad,Should have read the reviews first!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"BATTERIES LEAK!!! I usually don’t get consumed with reviews, but this time it directly affected me! I used to always order Amazon since they are the cheapest brand of batteries and have a good life! I’m not sure if they have changed the production, but it’s horrible now! Batteries totally ruined my lamp by leaking! I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. Stir clear!!! So disappointed in Amazon!"
JH in FL,Batteries leaked & lost charge quickly,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used 4 of these in an Electronic Pulse Massager in replacement of Duracell batteries previously used. These didn't hold the charge long at all and one of the batteries leaked a little bit. I would recommend to stick with Duracell even though it costs a bit more. I wish I would have read more reviews before purchasing these.
Whodey1029,Save your money.. DO NOT RECOMMEND,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total waste of money.. Spend the extra $$ and get a better battery. Put these in my Swiffer and they lasted a whole 10 minutes. Tried them in a remote control car and lasted about 15 min.. DO NOT RECOMMEND..
MrReview,Quality lower than before,2.0 out of 5 stars,We buy these batteries several times and the last two batches have been horrible. They barely last a full day like they did in the past. They are used in the same item every day and now they quit working about 45-60min sooner than in the past. Will stop buying the amazon brand batteries.
Clay Walker,These batteries do not last long,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These at first seem like a good value based on price, but the longevity for the 20 pack I purchased is terrible. I bought these to replace batteries in a digital scale that used to last months with a big name brand battery. With these batteries, I’m replacing every few weeks with little usage. I won’t purchase these again."
depscribe,Short life -- no bargain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you pay for.These batteries have very little life, even in low-load applications (in my case, Roku remotes not using voice commands). A four-pack of Duracells or Energizers would have lasted longer than a 20-pack of these. Alas."
Memphis Music Man,THEY WORK GREAT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got these for l a laser tag kit of four vests and four guns. They advertise a battery life of two hours on the laser tag vests and guns but there was plenty of power left after the grand kids used them. The batters come wrapped in groups of four and you probably save a lot of money buying a box of these if you use a lot of AAA or AA batteries around the house.
Rick Acosta,Great Value for the Price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did the auto renew on this and they come in handy! When you have 8 people living in a house, you don’t realize how many batteries you go through! Great value and last just as long as the expensive brands."
M. Frazier,Best batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our favorite batteries! With a toddler and teenager, we have to keep batteries at all times. Amazon basics are the best for their value and longevity. These are the only brand we buy now ."
Gonzalez ,So much better,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m gonna have to eat some crow on this. I was a firm believer in name brand batteries. I was under the assumption that Amazon batteries were low quality but how wrong I was. Will not buy any other batteries.
Ronnie Lee Rainwater,Wonderful product! I will always buy Amazon batteries from here on out!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the quality of these batteries and especially the value for the money. I will always buy Amazon batteries from now on. I wish I would have known about them sooner as a mother of 4!
Liz,Not value for money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry folks, these are terrible batteries. I have bought amazon batteries several times and have not had complaints previously.These ones lasted for less than a month in a toy train for my son. Initially I thought maybe it was the toy (even though it had not been used often).It was when the batteries I had put in the Firestick remote control lasted less than 3 months that I realised these batteries are junk. Remote controls need a very small amount of power to function, so 3 months is terrible."
L.G.Kindle Customer,Worth the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used only two batteries at this time, but they function well. They are well worth the cost to keep batteries on hand. I would not hesitate to order them again. I feel the purchase was well worth the cost."
Draexo,Great batteries. Perform as well as the name brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great batteries. Perform as well as the name brands.
Lightseeker,They don’t last,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst batteries I have ever bought. They burn out in short order. I used in a bathroom scale and they lasted less than a month, when compared with name brands that last for over a year."
Amazon Customer,"Batteries ok, plastic wrap sucks.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries seem OK, but they are shrink wrapped in hard plastic film which is very difficult to remove. Takes a knife or some other kind of blade, and then one risks cutting oneself. Couldn't a different kind of plastic film could be used just as cheaply?"
Patrick Haley,UNSAFE! Exploded battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We got a pack of 36 of these and the first couple I used went in a train remote for my 7-year old son. Lasted a few days and this morning, we heard an audible POP and found one of the batteries completely blown up--thus ruining the remote for his train. Unsafe. 0 stars."
Sarah F.,Good for price range!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value for the money, I use the AA and AAA for my remotes and they usually last a few months easily without being changed. Some of my children's toys don't last as long but these batteries are perfect for remotes, flashlights etc."
Edward P. Jankiewicz,Longevity,1.0 out of 5 stars,I put these batteries in several small candles in a candelabra (see picture) that I DO NOT light/use. I only lit the candelabra to test and to keep the batteries from leaking (TOTAL of NO MORE than 10 minutes over a period of three months). To my surprise the batteries died with virtually no use! I hope the rest of the 36 batteries last longer????
Misty,Short lifespan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hopes for these but the life span of these are just sad. You might get 1-2 months worth of life in tv remote. Any type of light source, not that long. Can't recommend these."
Larry Schaller,I use them a lot!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I stopped buying those name brands. I am not sure if these last as long but for the price I will take them. They do last long enough that I can tell they are a much better buy. Thank you
WA8UOC,Amazon basic batteries are of good quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have used these batteries in AA and AAA size for two years and have never had a problem with any of them. They have good life and I have never had one leak. I will keep using these.
Don Anastas,Easy to store in the boxes they arrive in,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So many gadgets, so little time.....and batteries. Don't run out of batteries at the wrong time and always have a variety of sizes on hand because gadgets that use batteries are not equal. AA, AAA, D - you get it. For the value per battery and the lasting power of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline why not get a bunch in all the sizes you need. Easy to store in the boxes they arrive in, pre-marked on the outside so make life a bit easier and keep your stuff working!"
Robert STL,Economical and Lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One thing I've learned is that we over pay for brand name batteries. And when you buy the cheap ones, they don't last. These are not only economical...they last. I'll never buy any other brand again."
Dr. Stuart Gitlow,Fresh batteries with labeled shelf life ten years in the future. Alkaline. Made in Indonesia.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries are packaged in sets of four so as not to short against one another and are easily removed from plastic without the need for any tools. My batteries arrived with a date stamp ten years in the future, perhaps a somewhat optimistic shelf life but clearly a fresh set of batteries. Have had no difficulty with any of them. No signs of leakage or other manufacturing defects. Made in Indonesia. Labeled as alkaline."
Tom Stiles (hamrad88),Less Expensive Alternate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery prices are insane and I have a ton of electronics that eat batteries so I thought I would try these as the price was much lower. They seem to work fine and appear to have close to the same battery life as the high priced ones. We will see if any leak and report back in a few months.
M P. Garner,No Hassle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the fact that I can make orders online and get the necessary things that I want and need so easily , being a senior person. I can eliminate the hassle of winter driving. And that pleases me so much!"
James Henderson,Batteries failed from the start!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries for small motion sensor lights that I planned to put in closets. An awesome feature of the lights is that they are both motion and light sensitive meaning the batteries wouldn't be drained during the day or when other lights are on, so they should last for a very long time. Not!!! I really love my lights but the batteries failed from the first day. To top off the failure is the fact that I gave lights and batteries as birthday presents to my mother and daughter. I trusted the ratings which were great. Amazon product, rated great on Amazon...?"
Mark,Short battery life,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor AAA battery life. These dropped to .99 volt while a Harbor Freight AAA alkaline battery dropped to 1.25 volt in a side by side test using a remote transmitting thermometer. Granted neither battery is a premium battery, but I was surprised at the short life of the Amazon Basics AAA alkaline."
C. COX,A waste of money,3.0 out of 5 stars,I placed these in GE LED candles on a timer. The first night they looked great. Its been a week of burning 4 hours a night and you can barely see the flame any longer. What a waste of money.
Jason,Cheaper than Costco!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I having been using the AmazonBasics batteries for a while and they perform very well. Lets be honest...batteries can be expensive. I used to order these from Costco but these batteries offer the same life span for a cheaper price. I also love the fact that I do not have to drive to a store just to get them. If you have children, you know how many batteries you can go through with toys and Xbox controllers. You can also get these on autoship every so often so you never run out."
JeanGee,Just average AA Batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know if it's the batteries, nature of the device(s) used, spending too much using the devices, or a combination of both, or all, but I go through quite a lot of AA batteries. They end up costing a substantial sum over, even a short time, because of this, and since I need them for my devices; such as a mouse, lighted magnifying glass (I'm getting old, so need one of these to see such things as the logins info for the many accounts needed these days), plus my two cable remotes."
Jody,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these batteries for my tv remote. They are a great value for the cost. They aren’t dead yet, but I’ve only had them a little while, so I don’t really know for sure about longevity."
Cody Stonehill,As good as the big brands!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After being loyal to Duracell and only buying Duracell, I thought it would be a good time to try out Amazon's take on batteries. I am not disappointed! The price is GREAT for the capacity of these! These last just as long as any Duracell I have bought. I will continue to buy these, for the value they offer!"
Mike Ochsenbein,good price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"buy these batteries all the-time for the price i think they work as goid as any, cheaper than duracell so i figure it is worth it and they work in grand kids toys which seems to go through batteries as fast as i can buy them, duracell dont hold up that much better"
mayur.panagar,Not good,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon brand batteries AAA’s does not work in Amazon fire stick remote I put brand new batteries Amazon brand And Remote won’t work , And then I bought a different brand batteries Duracell it was working completely fine"
Spiderman,AAA batteries wrapped in clear wrap,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 AAA batteries in cardboard box wrapped in clear cellophane shrink wrap.Great buy 10 year life. Tested Costco batteries and these. Both output same. Amazonbasic better buy
Jennifer E.,Is cheaper really better?,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gave this brand a shot as I normally would buy Duracell brand for my battery needs. Amazon brand lasted about 3-4 weeks in my T.V and bed remotes. Compared to Duracell which would last months when used before. I guess the saying goes you get what you pay for....while Amazon brand is less expensive they don’t have the ability to power longer than a few weeks so you find yourself changing out more often.
Krabinz,Brand new battery leaked and destroyed a device.,2.0 out of 5 stars,These were only sitting in an emergency LED flare for 6 months...and one of the batteries leaked and destroyed the device. This was an emergency LED flare for my vehicle. I will not buy these anymore and buy more brand names.
Amazon Customer,functional batteries.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These things work just like batteries, but they are cheaper and come in a big box so I don't have to buy more for a while. Other than that they are batteries. Buy them if you need to power things."
D,Batteries do not last - buy a real brand,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These (and all Amazon basics batteries I have bought) have very short lifespan and last dramatically less than name brand batteries. See my review of their 9V batteries which I unfortunately bought around the same time as these before I realized what poor quality these batteries were.I had thought batteries are a simple commodity and Amazon, or whomever it has contracted to make these, could make batteries of roughly the same quality as a name brand. I was definitely wrong. Buy a real brand."
firemedic2008,Great batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love Amazon batteries! They are seriously perfect for any application and are far cheaper than the competition. I have not seen any reduction in life since switching to these and they seem to handle better actually than most!
Dude From Elko,Good deal,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I buy these batteries with my bonus points. It is like getting free batteries. They do the job. Maybe not as good as some name brands, but much better than other bargain batteries."
April M McCafferty,Good deal,4.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are fine. They come together in shrink wrapped packaging that was a little difficult to open. The price is reasonable for the number you get. Time will tell how long they last and if they are good quality.
Tim Perkins,"Garbage, dont buy these AAA batteries!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolute scam, half the pack dies within 2 days in a tv remote and the others last maybe a couple weeks and yes Ive had for months and went through pack before reviewing. Id have actually saved money getting something reputable instead of taking a chance on Amazon garbage."
Emille,Received a bad batch.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've ordered these before and they worked great. But for some reason, this batch I received drained incredibly fast. I have a bug zapper I use these batteries for. Previously they'd last 6 months. The battery from this pack only lasted 2 days each time I replaced them."
Laken H.,Great value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value for the money! I can't speak on longevity, but the remote batteries are still going strong after about a month, so...seems like they're working great! Will buy again!"
jefo13,Do not buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy, batteries came exploded"
Cyndi & David Blake,"Good deal, good quality batteries",5.0 out of 5 stars,These are a great value for the amount that you get in this package. They last long and are just as good as many major brands. We will continue to buy these because you get more bang for your buck.
Dantes,but I’ve rarely received a package in such poor shape from AmazonBasics,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Came with another order. Both the box for the batteries and several individual 4 pack of batteries were busted open. Not sure how that even happened, but I’ve rarely received a package in such poor shape from AmazonBasics. Not pleased"
Jade,Low battery life,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these because I needed batteries during the pandemic. I am constantly replacing them in everything I use them in. With Duracell, the batteries last about 6 months. These are barely lasting a month, if a month. Same with other devices I have used these batteries in. I am better off buying the Duracell. A bit more money, but worth it."
Michelle Bertram,Great value and longevity,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are really great batteries for the price and work very well. Lasts for quite a long time and you can’t beat the price and if you have a Prime membership, get them the next day. Overall great batteries."
Clint Bradford,I Was a Duracell Purchaser for Decades ...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't been pleased with Duracells the past few years. Thought I would give Amazon's AA, AAA, and 9VDC batteries a try. And I am pleased: use in two-way radios, atomic clocks, flashlights - they equal or exceed expectations."
ksuze,All Batteries Dead in a week for LED candles on a timer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had bought these batteries because I had a dozen LED candles for decor up in my house. Trusting name brands and Amazon brand similar enough ordered these. Proven very wrong. Batteries were dead within a week. Switched to Duracell batteries still going. Will not make this mistake on batteries again.
Gaurav,Great value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its definitely a great value for money and extremely durable compared to the other batteries we get at the grocery storeI have been using it for more than a month and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase
CJ,Buzz buzz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price for the abundance of batteries you get. Keeps my wife’s vibrator buzzin..
Tom Clark,A bargain!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Been using these a few months and I really see no difference between the amazon batteries and the duracell or energizers. And these are waaaay cheaper so I'll be buying more!
Ryan Houlihan,Ehhhh,3.0 out of 5 stars,I'll only use these in tv and general device remotes. They don't last very long. A little better than the dollar store kind and you get more than the dollar store. Only will buy again due to convenience
Lindsey,great,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these off amazon because i was sick of going to the store and buying batteries for my xbox controller. These are great! They have a decent battery life, and the pack comes with so many!"
Eldey,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as described but half the cost of name brand. I only buy Amazon brand batteries because they last forever but they’re so affordable. I’ve been buying their brand batteries for 3 years now and haven’t been disappointed yet.
Amazon Customer,"dependable alks,",5.0 out of 5 stars,"dependable, have yet to get a depleted batch, unlike durcells and energizers, these have never disappointed, or been unworth package price for quantity, got these for wireless mouse, used by pairs, still have couple sets from previous order, these almost last as long as mouse says they will, i'll be interested if amazon ever decides to sell lithium batteries...."
Donald T.,Very difficult to use,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a replacement for a Panasonic blood pressure monitor, I have used it for roughly 2 weeks, and have experienced more error messages than actual measurements. The item does not stay secure on my smaller wrist, and can take up to 6 or more times to get an actual measurement. Even then I am not sure it is accurate as it varies widely from my Panasonic, and I am fairly confident that my heart is not beating as fast as it states."
A Branch,Work as expected,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great batteries and a great price. I've never had a problem with these and feel like they consistently run well and a nice length of time - I don't ever get the impression of ""Didn't I just replace these?"" with these batteries. Overall, I would recommend. Blessings!"
Amazon Customer,works as expected- great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,works as expected- great value
Ed,lasts long time,5.0 out of 5 stars,led candles still light up after 3 months
niki mckernan,DO NOT BUY!!!  Absolute JUNK!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I had read all of the other reviews from years past saying to stay away! They do not last!!!We did not have them long enough to damage our products - thank goodness!!! My husband put them in a safe 6 months ago (which we hardly ever open) and they are dead. Steer Clear and get a name brand you can trust!I am only writing this because I have not seen any recent poor reviews and Amazon clearly has not fixed the problem. I hope my review will help at least one person!
JustMe,Work Great For Me,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seem to be comparable to the big name brand batteries from what I can tell. I'm not getting leakage or DOA's from any of them so far, and I buy a lot, including different sizes."
P M,Didn’t work,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are lousy batteries that will not work even though I’ve tried them in different items. I appreciate that Amazon refunded my money, but do yourself a favor and purchase the brand name ones for a few bucks more."
Nancy L Saylor,"Not so ""hot""",1.0 out of 5 stars,"The batteries arrived on time at Christmas. They are packaged 4 to a pack and after using 3 or 4 packs at Christmas they were stored away in a cool, dry place. Today I needed new batteries for a toothbrush. I tried 4 separate, new from package, batteries. NOT ONE WORKED. I am very dissatisfied because the window to return is no longer available."
lexi mauve,"Don't bother, especially if they are for amazon fire stick remote.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother. I bought these to go along with my Amazon fire stick and they refused to work for my Amazon remote but they work for my other remotes that aren't amazon brand. This is stupid and ridiculous! Very u happy with my purchase.
lizE,Needed A Source For Buying These In Bulk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my outdoor decorative lights, but they require frequent battery changes. I was buying from a dollar store, but the batteries just didn't have any life. These are affordable and they last."
Techie,Short operating life,2.0 out of 5 stars,Used for remote control mouse and keyboard. Batteries run down in3-4 days compared to others lasting up to a month under same use and conditions. Will use up stock but not reorder.
Cathryn Choate,Do not last.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy. Put 2 AAA in TV remote (that doesn’t get used frequently) on November 15 and today January 24 are already bad. Not economical if I have to replace every two months.
Isaac Wasson,No 'no-leak guarentee',1.0 out of 5 stars,Get energizer or something with a no-leak guarentee. I've had several flashlights ruined by leaking batteries from Amazon and only just learned that energizer and I think duracell will replace your device if it's ruined by a leaking battery.
Michael Farrell,Junk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these batteries for three months. They state that they have a three year shelf life. They are supposed to be 1.5 volts. Of the ones that I have left, two are 1.2 volts, seven are 1.0 volts and one is .5 volts. I wouldn't buy these again. Total junk."
gloria m.,Triple A batteries are different sizes.,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries do not fit in anything I have. I just tried 3 different items. Can I return the batteries if I opened up the package
Joshua & Logan,In the land of battery operated everything....,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We keep a constant supply of all sizes of batteries from Amazon, if you haven't tried them....You are missing out on great value. 3 kids = lots of battery operated items. Amazon batteries = value and performance."
Oliver Klozoff,Not bad,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great batteries for items that do not pull a lot of energy from the batteries. In my regular remotes, these last a very long time. However if you are using the firestick, I recommend you buy energizers or duracell's. When I use these batteries in my firestick remote oh, I have to change them once a week."
Justin W,They’re batteries... that work for a short time,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: they don’t last that long at all. 100 have gone faster than any small, name brand battery pack ever would. Save your money and get a different brand. Would be interested in seeing how they compare time verse cost.Seem to last consistently and in line with any other decent batteries."
k'la,"Yup, they’re batteries",5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I got my fire stick, it came with the amazon batteries. They lasted forever, so I grabbed this pack of 36. Can never have enough batteries with all the electronics around these days"
Sydney F,Great Deal,5.0 out of 5 stars,I always order Amazon batteries! They are long lasting and a great deal. I just stick a pack in my kitchen junk drawer and it lasts forever!
Johnny Nuclear,"Leaked in a critical piece of medical equipment, rendering it temporarily unusable.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"They Leak.I had 2 of these in a small digital medical device, which is a top of the line brand Oximeter (measures O2 in the bloodstream as well as BPM, heart rhythm etc...) my 92 yr old mother has A-fib so when she gets out of breath i need to check the O2 level in her blood to decide if she needs supplemental oxygen. They worked well for about 8 months, but last week she was out of breath & when i went to check her O2 levels the Oximeter wouldn't turn on. I figured maybe the batteries just ran out of power so put some fresh ""Procell Duracell"" alkalines in (supplied by the hospital, its the only battery they use/ trust... but it still wouldnt power on. I measured both the Amazon Basics with a tester & they still read almost full, measured the Duracell's & they were 100% thus i thought the device went bad (less than a year old) but upon closer inspection i noticed one of the units 4 spring contacts had rust all over it, yet the other 3 contacts were clean. i looked at the amazon batteries & noticed one had been leaking from the negative end. I took a tiny file & carefully filed all the rust off the Oximeter spring, then finished cleaning it using a small parts brush/ contact cleaner. I put the Duracell's back in & thankfully the Oximeter worked perfect once again. However, If i hadn't had good access to that spring, i would have had to throw the oximeter out. Note- The Oximeter was always kept in a sealed medical bag, never exposed to humidity or radical temp. changes. I then removed any other Amazon batteries from the rest of my devices & noticed another one had started leaking inside my Klein Voltage tester- but luckily it hadnt fully rusted the contact yet because those contact springs cant be accessed & it would have ruined that devise.I hope my 2 cents saves a few people from ruining an important or expensive electronic item or render it unusable at a critical time, like it did in my case."
Edwina L. Smith,They died rapidly.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this product in the past with no problems, but this batch must have been old. The items for which I purchased them required 4 AAA batteries. I find these are lasting no more than a week. The first four kept my commode light going for quite some time...close to three and a half weeks. So far, I'm getting far less service than I expected...and this is a large pack of batteries. I can't recommend them."
Walter R. Weber,Need for classroom calculators,5.0 out of 5 stars,My district is broke and I have to buy my own batteries. This kept me going without waiting for a sale at my local supermarket. Much better quality than ones I bought at a discount hardware store that leaked.
ProfesserP,Awesome Batteries at a fraction of the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definetly the best value for the money over all . Awesome quality at a fraction of the price of any top name brand batteries. Amazon Prime deals are unsurpassed. Thank you again Amazon and Amazon Prime. You never let me down!
Wildthing33,Battery life,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries seem to last almost as long as the main more expensive leading brand. I use in an electronic floor safe and it greatly diminishes total life of the batteries. So for the price difference, these seem to be a better deal.."
Erica Leigh Durian,This gives us a nice stash at a great price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When you have young children, it is important to have extra batteries on hand for all of their toys. This gives us a nice stash at a great price. It also comes in handy when we buy gifts for the kids's friends that require batteries--we just put the needed amount in a small plastic bag and tape it to the box in case the parents don't have batteries already."
David M Vandenbush,So far so good,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Need to see how long these last and whether they leak when left in devices with minimal use. They are nicely packaged so I don't expect leaks in storage.
Choo-Choo-Kitty,Batteries. Yay.,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are batteries. What’s there to say? They work well. I used them mostly for my headlamps and remote controls. They didn’t explode on me so that’s a win in my book.
Cory,Last just as long as name brabd,5.0 out of 5 stars,These seem to work just as well as the expensive name brand batteries. I've had them in a couple items for over a month and havent had to change them so I would say they are doing good and I would buy again as needed.
Brezy,Great value! Life saver!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value and helps you avoid looking for batteries! Nicely packaged and came so quickly! I love that! Save yourself time and frustration and get 100 in double A's and triple A's.
Sivant,These batteries contain the specified amount of potential electrical energy ...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries contain the specified amount of potential electrical energy, have not suddenly started leaking caustic fluids, and were inexpensive compared to the competition. I do fear their production and pending disposal are a small contribution to our pending doom, but my flashlight now works."
Luc1f3r,Value deal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value buy but in term of lifespan probably little short side compared to other name brands. All in all I think is great buy if you use AAA batteries often but not a good buy if you use just few and store this(go with rechargeable).
David,Don't last,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a good value when you discover that these batteries do not last. I placed them in a battery operated light that I only used occasionally. Within a week, they were already showing signs of wearing down. I tried them in other devises and discovered the same issue. The price is OK for batteries needed in a pinch. Just not for longer term use."
David,AmazonBasics = Amazing Brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,"AmazonBasics has become a great brand that rivals the Energizers of the world. These batteries are an affordable price and a really high quality, especially when compared to the competition. With having a three year old, we are constantly running through batteries and it is great having these AmazonBasics type products out there to help middle income families like ours afford all the ""necessities"" that comes with having kids and just life in general (think remote control batteries)."
HappyHiker,Very poor batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries don't last. Supposed to be good until 2029, but half are already dead. Purchased in Feb 2020. The ones I did get to use ran down quickly. I will purchase other batteries until Amazon gets their quality control figured out."
Luther-sMom,cheap and easy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much to say, it's a battery, it's cheap, easier to buy on line than to go to a store so if you need batteries for your remotes, go for it, they work just fine and you can save yourself a little money."
E Adgate,Best Value of the AAs,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've watched some performance tests on various batteries and these Amazon basics were the best value and I would agree. You can get slightly better performance for a lot more money or lot less performance for a little less money.ProjectFarm on YouTube has a great performance test video.
Gixxer5,Most were already dying out,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After I received these batteries I loaded everything I needed to, within a days time the batteries were already dying out in 4 of the 5 items I put them in. I went through with an Ohm meter and checked the remaining batteries and they were at 1.0 volts instead of the 1.5 they should be and that's the ones I hadn't used yet."
CJ,These batteries work well - good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries work well. I particularly like the packaging - shrink wrapped tightly so it's easy to get the number I need without the rest of the batteries falling out everywhere. Good price.
Meghan L,Works just as good as the big brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband is so particular about name brands, but we did a side by side test with these in one of those automatic air freshener things and these outlasted the competition. I’m not sure why they did but to me that says they are at least as good as the name brand ones. With all the kids toys we have around the house, I stocked up on these in multiple sizes"
tonermd,Flammable?,1.0 out of 5 stars,After reading an article on the CNN website I went through my stock of Amazon Basics AA and AAA batteries and discarded all of them. Seems they have a problem with flammability.
Kelsi Potts,Packed well and a value,5.0 out of 5 stars,The batteries arrived packed very well and I’m now set on AAA batteries for the next 10 years thanks to Amazon. Cheaper than buying the same amount of comparable battery brands for sure
Connie,1v is not Good..,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought on Aug 2nd 2017, Oct 4th head lamp that I had loaded with these batteries when I received and had barely used, would not come on.Opened a new still wrapped 4 pack, loaded - light would not come on. checked batteries and found one of them had already leaked, while sonme unused batteries down to 1.1 volt or less. p.s. 1.1v is not Good...Put some Duracell AAA's in and I have light. Only 3 months. Not Cool..!!.."
sarah and Craig carda,IT Is a lot of batteries for the money!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whoa! There is a lot of batteries for the price! I needed them for several remotes so I cannot comment on how long they would work in toys or other things. But Its the same ones that I have in my previous remote and it lasted almost a year!Great value for the money.
Amazon Customer,FROM AN AMAZON ADDICT... DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT ORDER!!! I order EVERYTHING on Amazon but only 4 of these 36 batteries actually worked.. It didn't seem likely that all these batteries could be defective and I suspected my remote was faulty.. I tried a new universal remote, same results.. Then I tested each individual battery in a battery tester and sure as sh*t.... I just bought four batteries for the price of 36.... And a remote.... Do yourself a favor and stick to your local department store for batteries.. To those fixing to order, don't.. To those that already did... I hope you have a better experience than mine.."
Justin M,Amazoningly Amazing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what to say except these are such a great deal. So far the battery life is just as good as the name brands out there. Definitely consider these for your next battery shopping spree.
Sara J. Kelly,Great multipack of batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh these batteries! So neatly packaged in their tidy little box! My pepper grinder sat open, for only 2 days, awaiting the magical moment when these energy sources would arrive! Our remote control car goes faster and farther, thanks to these miraculous little buddies! My 5 year old can read late into the night, courtesy of a fresh pack of fuel cells in his flashlight. Thank you Amazon for providing the power for so many devices at a fantastic low price. We are forever grateful!"
swassociates,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,I go through tons of AA and AAA batteries and these are now my go to brand. These over Costco for sure.
HP,These batteries do not last as long as the Duracell ones.,2.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries do not last as long as the Duracell ones. Will not be buying these in the future. Costco has great offers frm time to time on duracell batteries.
Uschir21,Not for long term use.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You get a great amount of batteries for the price. These do not last but 2 days in an LED fish tank light, and no more than a week in other devices. While they are a great price, they do not seem to last very long."
nigel,Great battery for the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a great price for batteries. These have a great battery life, comparable to any other name brand battery. I've sets of these batteries and a few devices for long periods of time and they have yet to corrode unless something got spilled on them."
Tony,Works but and capacity is the same as any AAA battery brand,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If I'm going to get bulk batteries, there's definitely a particular bulk warehouse private brand that is cheaper and works just as well and has the same capacity."
Nakisha Greaves,Stick to Duracell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these because I thought they would last longer than the ordinary ones in my Alexa remote seeing that they are Amazon but they don't last at all. They last only days. One week tops. Waste of $$$$
Crickle,Great buy for the $,5.0 out of 5 stars,Repeat buyer of the Amazon Basic batteries- best value I’ve found. Have never had an issue with these & they seem to last longer than the Energizer ones I was buying previously.
themoreyouread,packaged well,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We go through a lot of these, that's why I ordered this big amount.They seem to work fine but I haven't used them very long yet.Nice box for storing them in, too."
JDConsumer,Misleading Amazon Advertising,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I searched for AA batteries and selected the option that appeared best, only to find upon delivery that they were AAA batteries. I did not search for AAA batteries. For Amazon to populate the choices with some AA battery options as well as some that look identical but are NOT AA is highly misleading."
Library Panda,Great batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very nice batteries in my OP they seem to be just as good as most name brand batteries not saying there too of the line or anything but they do a great job for the price much better than any other knock off batteries I've had
D8210,Pleasantly surprised,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was surprised when I saw this product. Amazon makes batteries? After reading some of the great reviews I decided to buy these. The price was great and after reading the reviews it was too difficult to not take a chance and try these out. I was definitely not disappointed. They perform well and get the job done. All of this at an excellent price. I won't hesitate to buy amazonbasics batteries again
Gigi0822,"Great batteries, great price",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great batteries at a very reasonable price. I have switched to Amazon Basic batteries for quite some time ago and they last as long as the name brand batteries.
KA,"WTF, Amazon? These batteries are crap",1.0 out of 5 stars,"They're defective. I bought them to use for a headlamp when hiking or walking after dark, and they repeatedly ran out of juice after just a few minutes, leaving me literally in the dark. I tried them in a different headlamp to make sure it was the batteries and not the lamp, and the same thing happened. Amazon, WTF?"
Victor,Cheap and alot of batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its just batteries so I don't really have much to say on this. I give it one good thing they did. They divided the batteries by 4 so its nice if you want to share or give batteries to a friend who needs some. The price was pretty cheap for the amount of batteries you get.
JMR,These don't work. Get a name brand from a company that tests their products.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A pair of these lasted only a few months in a Polder kitchen timer that normally runs for years on a set. Then I checked the rest with a known good Snap-On voltmeter; these ""new"" batteries read 1.33 volts. New ones normally read 1.5 volts or a bit higher. These were dead on arrival. They do NOT have a shelf life of 10 years. Unable to return them because it took me too long to figure this out.Note: I gave 1 star per category because 0 stars is not an option."
BARRY DIXON - PATRICIA,DO NOT BUY,1.0 out of 5 stars,BATTERIES DONT LAST
Ben,Don’t listen to the negative reviews.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The batteries are legit and do work just as well as the “name brand” batteries. Comes professionally packaged with shrink wrap around the batteries. Honestly sometimes when I read some of these reviews I actually wonder how these people function in life. Stories or corroded or dead batteries I guess is possible. Not likely though. Save yourself some money and buy these. I have bought three different occasions with no issues.
C L Jones,Very very short life,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these 6 months ago have had to replace them in the tv remote 3 times. I put cheep walmart batteries in the remote and the remote is still working 3 months later. I put them in a flash light and that dies in 1 monthIt's not worth getting these cheep batteries. They won't last.
Keith A.,Battery Life shorter than expected,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life is less than other brands. I switched back to a major name brand.HOWEVER, I have purchased so many Amazo Brand products and I Love them!"
Special Edition,They're not worth it.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed in theses batteries. Put them in 5 different devices and they didn't even last 3 weeks and all 5 devices went out at the same time, and I only used them for less than an hr only at night. Don't waste your money on these batteries, not worth it."
Electrosoft,Lots of power!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using the 100-count for quite some time and they are still working as fresh as day one when I bought the pack. I use them for flashlights, robotics, scales and decorative candles mainly."
CaliGal,Perfect package of AAA,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's that time of year to replace the batteries in a couple of flashlights especially with the power shutoffs here in California. These were perfect for my two flashlights and had a couple left over. The brand is reliable and the price is reasonable.
Jasmin,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for what you’re getting. These are essential when you have a baby for all the toys. They also last a while. I would recommend this. I’ve purchased both AA and AAA.
Daniel Collazo,They work,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price! Got to me quick. They work and thats all I can really ask for. The duracell batterys that came with my remote lasted about 2 months. So if I get 2 months worth hopefully more I cant complain.
Albert,Good price and convenience but packaging can be improved.,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the convenience of getting these affordable batteries via subscribe and save; rather than making a trip to Costco for Kirkland batteries. I would give 5 stars if the batteries were not wrapped in shrink wrap plastic - hard to open without scissors and creates more trash. Costco has better battery packaging.
C. Meyer,"Low quality, low price",3.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are cheap, both in price and quality. Don’t recommend putting them in anything important as they will leak battery acid. In fact they’re so shockingly low quality that I can, and did accidentally, crush the battery with one bare hand trying to get it out of the packaging. Wow.But if you have a bunch of cheap throwaway products you need to fill with batteries you won’t find a lower price... or quality."
wendy,Basics at a Great Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,We are going thru batteries quicker now that we are home working remotely - perfect items - perfect pricing - will be buying more in this size and other sizes
Jennifer Hansen,Weak!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had to replace all of the batteries I’ve used from this brand already, within 3 months. I didn’t even use them in high demand items (wall clock, TV remote, computer mouse)."
kb,Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Last as long as the high price bunny brand
Jolanda B,Not the best batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Put them in my electric candles and some of them turned off after just a few hours. Weird, the batteries have been ok in a previous purchase.Update after several purchases. These batteries don’t last long at all!! Even a simple electric candle doesn’t last long."
L. Hyer,These batteries are not worth the money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 months I had to replace the 4 batteries in my remote for the TV. The Duracell batteries lasted a year. Same thing with the track pad...just put these Amazon batteries in and barely 2 months later they need to be replaced. Yes, they are definitely cheaper than Duracell batteries, but I prefer quality and dependability."
Bill,Batteries leaked and Amazon WON'T warranty,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy....you get what you pay for. The batteries leaked and I asked for them to be replaced but they refused because it was past the 1-year limited warranty. The description says there is a ""10-year leak-free shelf life"" and when I brought it to their attention they said it is backed up by their 1-year warranty, which was over. What?! That's totally backwards. There is a whole section of the listing that talks about how reliable they are but they can't replace them or refund my money when they do exactly the opposite? I expect better from Amazon."
El Conquistador,Batteries for everything it seems,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We go through batteries like a fat lady at a buffet. Whether it is the tv remote, the vibrators, the flashlights or whatever...we change them a LOT. Amazon is dominating the marketplace with their own branded products and for the price, you can't go wrong here."
M. Paddock,Works great,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the money. No way I was gonna spend $50 on a battery-back up system. Was much more logical to get about 400 of these suckers and run them through a DC/AC transformer. Now i can have all the power I need without having to be ripped off by those over priced explosive Lithium Ion batteries.
Rico,Average,4.0 out of 5 stars,Average performance at an average price. Reliable expiration date. I think that there is confidence by using the Amazon name.
Nacho Libra,Great batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I always buy these, they last much longer than dollar store batteries, but not quite as long as the name-brands at the store that cost much more. No problems with leakage or exploding either."
Sandra C,Great Product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!
Trudi Devine,Short life.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At about half the price of Duracells I thought these were a great deal and worth a try. When they arrived I replaced the batteries in my remote. They lasted 4 months and when I opened the remote the batteries had the white powder on them. They were leaking. Duracells last a year. So these are half the price, but last a third of the time.‘You get what you pay for.’"
Robert C. Nasir,"Good batteries, in quantity, at a good price.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lots of good quality batteries on the shelf, there when you need 'em, at a decent price. Seem to last as long as any mid-grade alkaline. What's not to like? Recommended."
Blaze & Melissa,Great battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love our amazon batteries great price great quality we have bought words of them. Our daughter has a lot of toys and they all seem to need batteries so Our go to is always amazon brand
Larry Davis,Value price super power long lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with this amazing selection, not only did it same me time but a few dollars too. Didn’t thing it would but it did. And yes, would buy it again."
TFields,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries were a waste of money!!!!! I bought these a month and a half ago and my tv remote batteries have died already!!!!!The last set of batteries I had in this remote lasted for over two years!!
Harvey Clyde,Good value.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Let's see how they last.
Mrsaj213,Unreturnable dead batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,All the batteries were dead and didn’t even have enough juice to operate a wireless computer mouse. And on top of it Amazon is now allowing me to return it because it’s outside of the 30 day window. That’s what I get for trying to stock up on batteries and use them 35 days later. Shame on your Amazon. Your Your return policy on your own stuff is awful.
luvamazon,Terrible product! I would give a -1 if it were an option.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed in this product. Will not purchase again. Does not hold a charge even for a small clock for more than a week. I have used other brands have lasted for years. My daughter-in-law had the same experience.
Lorraine M.,GOOD BATTERIES FOR REASONABLE PRICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The price for the quantity is unbeatable. No remote comes with them so could not rate ""Remote Control"" and really can't rate the ""Longevity"" yet because I haven't had a chance to use them much to see how long they will last."
K.M.,"Cheap, but don't last long",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought this would be a good deal as the price is pretty reasonable. But I soon realized that I'm replacing batteries a lot more often then I ever have. I've had remotes that came with batteries included that look off brand and cheap, but then realized they lasted for years. Replaced some of those and now I'm changing the batteries every few months. So, yes they are cheap, but I guess there is a reason why they are. Will pay more next time for better batteries."
Rhonda,It is quite a bit cheaper to buy these batteries this way.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the bulk batteries. I use a lot of batteries for my candles and outside twinkle lights that are remote controlled. These batteries last just as long as if you bought them somewhere else.
Maggie Heffelfinger,Cheap,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries did not last long. They are just slightly better than the Harbor Freight batteries. No competition to name brand batteries. I bought AA and AAA. Both types performed much worse than expected.
Sunny Doodle,MY FAVORITE BATTERIES,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very picky about the batteries I use. I always used duracell. Ever since I tried Amazon brand, It is the only one I use. They last just as long, maybe longer."
Dave_H,Works great for the price!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply awesome. Came on time and works well. Also price is very competitive to some other known brands out there.Only area where they can improve a bit is packaging. If you open one all are exposed so if they can give better casing it would be great.
A. Richardson,NEEDS A URGENT RECALL - FIRE HAZARD - BEWARE Some of the batteries get VERY VERY hot.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Fire hazard. Some of the batteries get very very hot. Luckily I noticed the excessive heat before I went to bed, because I don't think I would have ever waken up. I inserted a pair into my remote control, and within 30-minutes they got very hot. Once I removed the batteries, I noted that this was the only component that heated. I tried it again just to ensure it wasn't the remote, but yup its the batteries."
Michele C,Long lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are a great value and long lasting. I would definitely recommend to my family and friends
john derenze,GREAT BATTERIES  GREAT PRICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT BATTERIES
HAROLD HUNTER,Value for the money.,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries go for a really long time in all our remotes through out the house. 100 triple A's for $20.00 now that's a good deal. I was sold on these batteries when they came with my first fire stick. Great product!
Trudi Clay,Do not buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these batteries for my remotes and I have to replace them within weeks. I went back to buying batteries at Costco. Do not waste your money on this product.
Thomas,There are cheaper options,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s good stuff. Working pretty well. But I found out that the batteries in Costco or Walmart are all actually cheaper than this. Not sure if there are any difference tho.
randy jordan,Not so great....,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that."
Casey,PRICE & PACKAGING 🤞,5.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I should wait on this. Remote control going strong but I cannot seculate on how long. I do give you permission to include a score if you have the calculation. Just do it.
Kris Kidd,Great price and close to the longevity of me brands.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've purchased these before. They are good batteries. Not much to say.They don't seem to last as long as the top brands, but they still last quite a while. Pretty close.At such a low price, I wouldn't even consider buying the more expensive brands that might cost double.And I like that it comes in such a large quantity. This many batteries will last me a long time."
Ron M,The life of batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have no idea what “remote control” means. But the over all rating would be good. Good product, good price, of course only used a couple batteries but good strength. I’m satisfied."
dena l.,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Let's be honest you can't get batteries for a better price than Amazon. These batteries last forever are delivered quickly and are a great value for the money. These are a must buy
chauncey2,AWESOME batt's at an AWESOME price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have now used these in every size & I can truly state these last just as long as the ProCells for a lot les $$$.I use them a lot in my BOSE head sets which will use up a lot of batts when cranked.These actually last longer than other batts from the big boys except the ProCells, which may be what these are"
khalia Spencer,"I keep buying these, they are that good",5.0 out of 5 stars,I will continue to buy these batteries they are that good. The price and how many you receive is awesome for such good batteries. They are long lasting.
Summer,Great deal for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,We got a box last year for Christmas(2018) because most of the toys needed AAA. None of the toys have needed replacement batteries except one that gets played with daily. Our tv remote has been replaced a few times but no more then usual.
brad,DO NOT BUY!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst batteries ever. And I say that cause I don’t want to curse on here. They don’t work long at all. Learned the hard way, put them in a trail camera. Came back excited to see what’s on camera. All the cameras were dead after one day. So I opened new pack at home and they barely read 1.2 volts. Waste of money and lost of two months."
Drew,High quality batteries for a real discount,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have bought several products from the Amazon basics line of products and continue to be impressed with everything they have made. The batteries are as you would expect AA size batteries to be. They have a good weight to the batteries, not like cheap dollar store batteries.They seem to power all my devices, including high current devices well. So far they have not leaked or cause any problems. I feel for the price you cannot beat the quality of these batteries.I would recommend the purchase of these batteries."
samantha hicks,I purchase 2 every month on subscription,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are just as good as your name brand high dollar batteries most of the time. Occasionally I’ll get a batch that seem to have less juice, but they are batteries that’s to be expected I think. I’ll continue on until I don’t need the batteries anymore."
Barbara Shipka,all 10 of them are working fine now and the new batteries have been in them ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy! The 'best' ones lasted less than an hour in a light that requires three! Some dimmed immediately and lasted only a few minutes. Since all of the lights failed, I first assumed it was the lights. Then I thought, well, perhaps it's worth it to change the batteries and see what happens. Sure enough. The lights...all 10 of them are working fine now and the new batteries have been in them for weeks. I guess it's a good example of 'you get what you pay for.' The new batteries I bought cost a bit more than double but have already given me 10X more value."
Alex,What happened Amazon?,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries did not last. From the beginning, no power. Will be requesting a refund and not opening the AA batteries."
Cynthia Jones,Batteries need a better price,5.0 out of 5 stars,I thought it would be more for the price but I see that it wasn't looking at itlooking at it on the internet it made you think that you had a bigger box I was surprised how small the box was when it arrived considering the price I would not be perking this any longer again
JC,Batteries were dead before I even used them,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just about every one of these batteries were dead before I even used them, about a month after purchase. Usually happy with Amazon Basics products, but beware the batteries.Editing to add: The same thing happened with the pack of AA batteries! Coming up on the brunt of hurricane season around here and I have no faith in these products whatsoever. I'll be putting my faith on other batteries from now on!"
mommysbored2,"So far, so good",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these for some battery operated Christmas lights, so far so good. Easy to install and store like the named branded batteries. Quality is there."
MB.5,A Bargain and Long Lasting,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am so glad that I came across these batteries from Amazon. They last much longer than the expensive name brands that I have been purchasing almost every two weeks for my computer mouse. And... they work very well. You cannot beat the price, but most of all they work."
Aarron cassell,I don’t think they’d keep the energize bunny going for long.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these and they’re good for the price but they don’t last long. Maybe it’s just me? But I have older batteries in things and have had to replace these more than once
Becky RomslandAmazon Customer,Awesome batteries and price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m always so happy to receive these batteries because you simply can’t beat the price and quality of these batteries! We go through a lot of batteries around here!
Arun,Less expensive but good one overall,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are less expensive but meets my needs.. it works fine with all my remote controls.. just gave 3 stars for longevity since I started using this couple if weeks back.. hope this lasts long
shanliang,good,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Use the batteries for my truck! Lasted a lot longer than I expected, usually don't purchase but I will definitely reconsider! The packaging of the Duracell definitely has a upgrade and looks a lot better!"
Stan,"Just as good as the ""name brand"" batteries",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why spend more on ""name brand"" batteries when you can save some hard earned dollars and get these Amazon branded batteries. I have no compliants and will buy again when they eventually run out."
Matthew,These suck! Just like the rest of Amazon!,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are terrible!!!!They lasted 3 months in a remote I use for a couple hours every other evening! 👎🏻
DogsGalore,Lasts about a day,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Says these do not expire til 2029. Just in ONE week, I have replaced these AA battery’s four times in a TV remote that never lights up or uses voice activation! Just a simple remote. These batteries have been a nightmare. I can only imagine if it was for a child’s toy!"
Bill Martin,You get what you pay for,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use AAA batteries in a blood pressure cupAnd the work just fineBut I’m not happy seeing their made in ChinaNext time I’ll buy USA
Lindsay,fine battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have not had any issues using amazon brand things. This was a good deal for batteries and everything was there and working good. I got the AAA pack
Amazon Customer,Such high quality batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these batteries. It is such a relief to find high quality batteries for such a reasonable price! I’ve used them in toys, remotes, flashlights, etc. and they last for a really long time! I definitely recommend ordering these!"
DELMA LOZANO,Great batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,THESE BATTERIES DO AN EXCELLENT JOB FOR ME. I have problems with lights so I use Candles. With timers My eyes are very sensitive to lights so these helps me and the batteries are great I use all sizes of the Amazon Batteries.
jeff,1/6 the longevity of Duracell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The life of these batteries is terrible. I use them for my front door keypad lock and they are lasting about 2 to 4 weeks. Duracell’s were lasting 6 months. Not worth the savings if I have to keep replacing them, door won’t lock once they lose their charge to prevent locking yourself out so it’s a pain to be on the way out and have to stop and replace them every few weeks."
kr36303,Excellent Battery Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these batteries after seeing a youtube video that rated five or six of the most popular alkaline batteries. There performed very well and were very close to the top of the rankings. The youtube video was very well done with professional equipment to test the battery output and total energy stored for each brand. And it had a value ranking based on performance. It would be well worth your time to watch the video before you buy batteries but these were by far the best value.
Dr. Tony,Good so far.,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries power my lights and have lasted a long time. And I reorder the same kind.
Joseph Ashby,Wrong package to wrong address,1.0 out of 5 stars,"product may be ok, but I may never know as the package I received was not addressed to me or even at the same street address. I took it down the street to ANOTHER street where it belonged, and I may never know what happened to MY package."
nyamulani,Last a long time.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They stay for a long time, I use them in my remote control. The price was good, I am glad I bought them. When I finish this package I will buy more."
Vic Barber,Very satisfied,5.0 out of 5 stars,The AmazonBasics batteries are just as good if not better than the name brand batteries at nowhere near the cost. I have been very happy using them.
Jullie Flaugher,Great value for your money,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for almost everything...not so good for high powered things like RC cars though.
William,Great value for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"With the amount of batteries for the money we spent, we don't have to worry about running out of batteries again. I always struggle with going to the drugs store to buy small pack of battery everytime we run out. With the same amount of money, I can get so much more using the Amazon brand. Very reliable battery! Definitely recommend!"
Ryan,Terrible batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are terrible. Our local grocery store had their own brand but the price went up. Thought I would try these instead but they don't last long at all. These are not worth the money, go buy a store brand instead!"
Jenn Mehrtens,Batteries DO NOT WORK in my remote!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these for a mirror, batteries died within a week. They don't even work in my firestick remote. What a rip off! I tried to get a refund and they say its returnless. So disappointed :("
Michele M Wecker,Great value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have repeatedly bought these for controllers and camping items, as well as certain office products. I store them in the fridge. We are delighted with the quality and price. I highly recommend this line of batteries."
sondra ernst,Die almost immediately,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 20 of these in August for my remote controls and I have already used 14 of them. I usually change my remote batteries once every couple of years, but I have just changed them for the third time in two months. Think about it. Junk."
Hong Dexter,Affordable,4.0 out of 5 stars,I had some duds in the mix of batteries. That’s my only complaint. They last just as long as any other brand. Also sometimes comes unpackaged.
W T,Great Product for Everyday Usage- Beats out name brands at twice the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Recieved the product promptly by Amazon, prior to using the Amazon Basic brand I would purchse the Maxwell. Altough a great product the price point on Amazon Basics was superior and the quality appears to be lasting longer than the Maxwell brand. I would compare these to other name brands. I have children that have every gaming device known it seems and the lentgh of usage is holding up to daily use. Great product and like the idea of anti-corrosion components and new zinc composition resulting in 10-years anti-leakage. I've used this in professional photography flashes and they are holding up well after several flash responses that need to generate a higher than normal recovery rate. Amazon did well, highly recommend the purchase."
joe,Dont waste your money,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly they don't last long. They lo literally lasted a week in my remote control and I dont even watch that much tv. I wont purchase them again.
Maureen,worth what your pay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for value
David Harris,Buyer beware - DOA out of the box,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Half of the batteries in a box of 20 were completely dead right out of the box when brand new. What’s even worse is that this is Amazon’s own brand of batteries. My advice, buy a better brand of batteries at an actual store, not from Amazon. I have never once had this issue from store bought batteries of any brand, name brand or generic."
Carlos Rivero,Dissapointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, this batteries are super cheap in comparation with another brands but in my case, they didn't last as long as they should, which is the most important thing in this kind of item."
tracy d metcalf,These batteries suck,1.0 out of 5 stars,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  I had to purchase more batteries because the Amazon brand i bought keeps dying after the using them for a day or two.
Stitch ,Great batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these batteries and I find them to be very good when it comes to replacing my remote control batteries for my 4 Television sets around the house.
Katie Buckner,P,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Used in the million baby toys around the house that require batteries. Haven’t had to replace any yet & have been used daily for a couple months, so longevity is pretty good. Don’t spend extra money on brand name batteries, these work great!"
Elise,These batteries don't last in storage.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After sitting in a cool drawer for 2 years (unopened) these batteries are dead. Based on the expiration date on the package, these should have lasted to 2028. Lame."
Michelle Richardson,Math?,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hmmm...package states 36, but by my calculations, 8 packs of 4, always equals 32."
Claudia Larsson,Dead batteries!,1.0 out of 5 stars,It seems like not all the batteries work! I now have 5 out of the pack that are dead. I just recently opened! I’d like someone to contact me please!!
Kenny,Not very Bright,1.0 out of 5 stars,"About as bright as a small key chain light and the magnet, cannot even hold itself sideways on a toolbox.....just slides down and down gaining speed until crashing onto floor lol....weak magnet, dim light.Light dim enough it wouldn't even attract bugs. Oh, and I did put new batteries in it thinking that was it....nope just as dim."
Amazon Customer,They are ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They last half the time of brand name battery and ends up costing more. I used in flashlight, headlight. Cat toys. They worked ok for remote. Been two months and still working in remote"
Natalie,As good as the name brand batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these batteries. They are a great deal compared to the name brand batteries. They last just as long and I’ve never had any issues with them.
Kim T,Leaky batteries!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy Amazon brand batteries. They leak terribly and if they don’t, they don’t last long!! 10 year shelf life is a bogus claim!! See photos."
Kimberly K,We will continue to buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,We buy these in different sizes and they are a great value. They last as long and run our electronics as well as the more expensive name brands.
Todds Books,A good choice for devices that require very frequent battery changes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"In longevity tests, these batteries outlast Duracell's standard Coppertop battery by about 15%. If you have RC toys or other devices that use lots of batteries quickly, these may be your best bet in cost per battery."
Stephanie,Love Them!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love AmazonBasics batteries, and these are no exception. The package is easy to open, and the batteries are neatly bound in sets of 4. Most devices use an even number of batteries, so this really helps. You only open what you need, and leave the rest safely stored in the box. So far, every battery I have used works. I can't comment on how long they last, as I just opened these within the last few days."
Hockeyman30,Just as good as name brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,I buy these all the time. Just as good as brand name and I actually think they last longer. You get more batteries for your money and the same good quality.
Pleased ,Great value Very happy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value & very happy. Last as long as the expensive big name guys batteries, I have not found a defective one because I test the majority before I use them."
Hello Kitty,Great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for your money I needed these for my fire stick remote and I haven't had to change them in months like I had with other batteries in the past.
Rob Wehrli,Buy in bulk and get prime delivery,5.0 out of 5 stars,These seem to do the job very nicely. I use these in a wide variety of devices and they seem just as useful as the 'brand' names that cost much more. I now buy these in all cell sizes so that there is always a reasonable supply on-hand.
Tamara Davis,Sooooooo many AAA batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,No one needs this many AAA batteries. I only needed 2 but this was the best value for the money. The rest will likely go bad. Appreciate the price though. Just have 34 extra batteries.
AmazonCustomer630,Good value priced pack of alkaline batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,Normally we will only ever use Rayovac alkaline batteries however these are also good alkaline batteries for the price in a value priced pack. We had ours for one full year before ever opening the box to use them and they work great.
smgu3,Batteries leak,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased in October 2019 I went to use some in April 2020 and found several leaked. Go to show ya get what u pay for! Suppose to be good till 11-2028. No way. Wish I could add the photos.
KLL,Great Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like these for three reasons:1. Amazon always sells these for a good price. They are a lot cheaper than Duracell or Energizer.2. They last just as long as other name brands.3. I have NEVER had an issue with leaking batteries from AmazonBasics.I will continue to buy these as long as they are offered!

JJ,Reliable batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great batteries, best value that I could find. Hopefully it'll last for 10 years on shelf. It seems comparable to duracell and the big name batteries"
cool in Rocklin,I wasn't sure because I've always been a duracell girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nobody is more surprised than me but these batteries are really good. They last really long and the price is really good. I have them now in AA, AAA, D, C, and 9 volt."
Koala,Last long and great price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never will I buy another expensive name brand battery! Amazon's batteries last very long, and even longer than the expensive name brand companies! Loved the price and the quality has come out to be long lasting!"
James Fyfe,I replaced the batteries with energizers and the remote control worked fine. Then I checked to make sure I just ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries don't work in all devices. I put them in my remote control for Sony TV and they did not work. At first I thought my remote was broken because the batteries were brand new, but that wasn't the case. I replaced the batteries with energizers and the remote control worked fine. Then I checked to make sure I just didn't get a bad batch of Amazon batteries by putting the batteries in another device and they did work..... Very weird, but from my experience these Amazon batteries don't work in all devices."
Chuck,Works as well as name brand batteries for me,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the ease of getting these. They seem to have a decent shelf life and work well in my stuff with good longevity and no real problems noted. Bought them a few times now.
Tony,Great Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been buying Kirkland batteries from Costco, but now with Covid I'm trying to go less. Amazon batteries is a little bit more cheaper than Costco and I feel the quality is as good as Kirkland."
Amazon Don,Can't beat the price for decent performance.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tested a few random batteries (out of a 36 pack) and they tested exactly the same as an 8 pack of Duracell that I picked up locally last week. Of course, these were much cheaper. The only thing that I found fault with is the lousy packaging and I'd only take 1/2 star off for that. Of course Amazon doesn't allow that, so I'll go with 5 stars and revise it down the road if they leak of fail in some way."
Mjo,"Great price, long lasting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good!!! We go through batteries pretty quickly around my house. The price was good & so far they’ve lasted in everything I’m using batteries for!

They are a great value longevity is great we have lots of kids walking through the hallways and up the stairs they are still bright after 2 weeks of use. They are super bright. Great for lower cabinets and under top cabinet lighting.
Jim Humphrey,Good batteries. Good price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good batteries that work well in devices like remotes and other low current devices. Haven’t had any problems with them at all. I will continue to order Amazon Basic batteries because they work well and inexpensive in quantity.
theresa g.,You can't get quality for this price,5.0 out of 5 stars,I used to run to store for batteries so often and especially around holidays. I have lots of candles and lanterns. I will never run out of batteries again! AMAZON IS THE ANSWER. Great for longevity and best price anywhere. Why would anyone shop anywhere else!!!
J. McLaughlin,Worthless,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I put two of these into my wireless mouse and in one week they were dead. trying the other two now and not looking good for them either. don't waste your money on these, stick with Duracell."
Nikita,Better than store bought,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon batteries are well worth their value!!!! Longevity is longer than any other store bought batteries. I can buy a 36 pack of Aa's and AAA'S for less than $30 and they last all year, if not longer."
Chao Rong,BUY THIS INSTEAD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After years of buying Duracell's expensive batteries, I decided to switch over to this Amazon Basics one. It lasts 50 hours in my Xbox One controller and hundreds of hours in my mouse."
Zach Burks,You get what you pay for in life,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are absolute crap the length of time that they last is abysmal at best I would just spend the extra dollar or to get Duracell or Energizer or another top brand I bought these twice and I've been very disappointed each time
aseriousloverofbooks,These have a great life span in my computer mouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been very pleased with the long life of these batteries in my computer mouse. I've tried pretty much every other brand and they don't last. I bought these not expecting such good performance I just wanted a low priced battery and I am very pleasantly surprised.
tw,Failed too fast,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this pack one month ago. They are used to light LED lamps for no more 20 minutes a day. The batteries stopped working already. I am not buying them again.
Di,Handy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I go through batteries. I always keep small flashlights hanging on all the doors in my house. We get strong winds and when the electricity goes out you can always find a flashlight
Jencmar,Great Deal - Great Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,Your browser does not support HTML5 video.  This is all I’m ordering from now on. We use these mostly for our indoor motion detector safety lights for my in- laws when they get up at night & can’t reach the light switch down the hall.
TerminallyAle,"These worked well, until I had a 4pack that didn't work at all",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had no bad experience with these batteries until now. These came packaged in a lot of smaller, 4 pack containers wrapped in plastic. I have now had two 4 packs in a row not work at all, so roughly 20% of the batteries I bought are not working. I still have a few to go, so that number may increase. Any savings I realized by buying these have essentially gone out the window. For reference these have a use by date of 10-2027, so well within the normal product lifetime.With that being said, the ones that did work worked well while they were in use."
Nikki Kutz,Save the packaging from your old batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You get the batteries but they come plastic wrapped in rows of 10 or so but they don't have any packaging for storing them. So, not totally what I expected. I haven't had them long enough to really test their ""life expectancy"" but they seem to work just fine."
D. at LLRC,"BAD DEAL, THEY LEAK EVEN IN STORAGE NOT EVEN IN USE YET",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries leak BOTH on machines and just in plastic storage container. I have lost two finger OX2 monitors because this dam things leaked, and threw away 6 others that had not even be in any item.AS I FOUND OUT THESE ARE A BAD DEAL"

Paul Feinberg,Why Buy other Brands? These do the same thing and are cheaper,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These amazon basic batteries work great. I have had no problems with them. They come nicely packed, and seem no better of life than other name brands. We always purchase these."
John,Great value for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice batteries. Work in the product real well was a lot better than going to the store and buying name brand batteries will you changed and use these all the time now.
RnR,Cost/Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,The length of these batteries are great. I'll use these trom now on. It's a GREAT deal for your money. Can't go wrong. Try for yourself. Trust me.
Sara Jane Douglas,These work great and are super cheap!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have NEVER before ordered batteries from Amazon, only bought them at the store, and this is amazing to be able to stock up as nothing is worse than running out of batteries at home when you need them the most :)"
Johnny's girl,Now I Am Supplied,5.0 out of 5 stars,I hate running out of batteries and now I don't. These are great quality and I love having enough. They come in a sturdy cardboard box for great keep-age.
Amelia Hackett,terrible longevity,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely terrible longevity. Bought these only a weeks ago and put into my Halloween decorations and are already dead and need to be changed. Whereas other decorations I have that had batteries in them from LAST year are still going strong. Don’t waste your money.
MR.J.,Amazon basics AAA batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon basics AAA batteries are of good quality and I have not had any trouble with them or out of them. I would rate them up there with Duracell batteries for performance.
Chris L. Sockman,Better than name brand batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Initially learned about amazon (private label) batteries from our friends who live in St Croix. They used them for 4 months for their flashlights and lanterns after Hurricane Maria took out their power for months. My son uses them in his game controllers and they last for several weeks at high usage, too."
David S.,Leaking batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these in June 2019 so it's past the return window.They are still in the packaging and are leaking badly.They are advertised having a 10 year shelf life!Since this happened to the unopened items already,I will be removing them from all items which they were installed.The expiration date is 01-2029"
Jennifer,Great value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work just as good as ""brand name bunny"" but half the price! Highly recommend. My kids toys go through batteries quickly so this is a great option to save $!"
bryan2103,"Great value, they’ve lasted longer than expected",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries have lasted a lot longer than I expected. I use them in my pocket flashlight, which I use a lot during the day. I think they’ve been in my light for about 3 months now and haven’t had to change them yet."
Daniel,Value Pack was very affordable,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was sort of worried that since these batteries were such a low price that they wouldn’t last long but they seem to be lasting just as long as any other battery so I think they were a great value for the low price that I got them for and I would buy them again.
Mom,Very Short Life!,2.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased these for my set of 3 battery operated candles. Each candle requires 3 batteries. I keep them on the lowest timer mode (4 hours per day) and these batteries last only 2 weeks! Last season I used Duracell and the batteries would last 4 weeks to a month. I do not recommend and will not purchase again.
Pedro R.,Very affordable !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love these batteries best price for good strong batteries and you get 3 packs enough to cover all my accessories that use the batteries i purchased happened to be triple As , happy customer I’ll buy them again !"

Marcus,Have 75% less charge than other batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,I love Amazon products but not these batteries they have no charge and die very soon. They may be less expensive than other batteries but what good is that if they die 75% faster then other batteries. Will not buy these batteries again.
darklysewn,everyone needs extra batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"you never have enough batteries, esp this size, this size goes in so many things, esp my timer candles that pop on at night. it's cool, it's kinda spooky cool, my friends freak out when it happens. get extra batteries, you never know when the power will go out and you will want spooky cool candles to pop on...oh, and these have a long life, they are really great for ""basics"""
Amazon Customer,Missing 40 batteries,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The package comes with 2 boxes, 50 batteries each. I opened the second box after 3 weeks of use and I only received only 60 batteries in total, instead of 100 total. Most of the batteries are good, but some are as good as half used. I'm a long time Amazon customer and I'm very disappointed. It seems like the deadline is past due for my refund, so I'm leaving a 1 star review. If it's possible, I would like a refund for 40 batteries."
Kaitlyn,Good battery for a good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They work just as good as other brands but are a much better price. In my remotes they lasted a couple months, in my kids toys they lasted as long as other brands we really couldn’t tell the difference."
B. Burn,Good battery for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are great, especially if you have kids. We go through a lot of batteries in all the toys and remotes and buying these saves us money. They seem to last as long as the other brand name batteries out there."
Kindle Customer,Not worth it anymore.,1.0 out of 5 stars,We have bought these batteries for a couple years now. Our last two boxes haven’t lasted long at all. Our most recent box we’ve had for a week and we’ve had to change the remote control batteries twice now. As soon as we change the batteries the remote says battery low right from the start. I’m starting to lose faith in these batteries and don’t feel they’re worth it anymore.
barb0710,Great Value‼️,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the quantity and the durability of these batteries. We buy a box for ourselves and each of our adult children at Christmas time so that we are all ready with a supply for when our grandchildren come to visit and play with items needing fresh batteries. It helps mom & dad to keep a supply on hand at home also.
Sandra,do not last,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Usually I buy duracell bateries and we all know how expensive those can be. I purchased this hoping to save some money but it ended up costing me more, This batteries do not last! They probably lasted 2 weeks before we needed to change them again, and I mean dead dead in 2 weeks. Would not recommended them."
dmoss58,DO NOT BUY!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy these!!!!!!! Only about 4 were good. They are bad, bad, bad!!!!!!!"
Brittany A,Buy these over name brand!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product came fast. Packaged well. Best bang for your buck, especially when you have small children with a lot of battery operated toys!"
Schweetpea,nice packaging and good so far,5.0 out of 5 stars,"What can I say, batteries are batteries. First time buying AmazonBasic batteries and so far so good with no issues with battery life. I like how it is packaged in a nice compact box that's easy to store as well (it's the little things :))"
GeekGirl,"Have ordered several, and they always work",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely no complaints at all. They are cheap, I can get them in bulk, and they have always worked. Would give more stars if I could."
mike ali,Not worth it,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not worth the money. Yea you get a bunch but they don't last for anything. And I believe that's why you get so many. Don't waste your money spend a little more for less on Ankers batteries, so much better."
Lindsey,Works,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my 1st purchase of amazon batteries. I just used the AAA for my wireless keyboard and it works.Not much to say with batteries 😂
TC,Battery cap exploded,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had one of these batteries in a wireless mouse (Anker) and heard a loud pop. Opened the battery cover and the top of the AAA battery had exploded off with battery acid leaking inside the mouse. I usually like Amazon Basic items but now I am a little wary and after reading similar reviews it seems like quality control is lacking at Amazon. Hey Jeff you might want to recheck those Blue Origin rockets.
Madi,AAA+,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems great, not sure about longevity, but there's A LOT for a small price. Came neatly in a nice compact box, instead of a plastic casing so it pretty much comes in something you can store it in."
Rum Ham,Good life and value,5.0 out of 5 stars,These seem to be good batteries at a decent price. I saw a YouTube video on battery life/price and these performed well so I bought them. No complaints
Dr. A,Don’t waste your money,1.0 out of 5 stars,Straight out of the package at least 1/2 have been DOA. You wouldn’t know if you don’t use all the batteries at once but even unopened they shouldn’t start out dead.
Greg,They're batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon batteries are cheaper than the big name brands, but much less in cost. we buy these in high volume and the price is crazy-low."
Kacy King,Horrible longevity,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my amazon firestick remote. I literally use the remote to open Disney+ and press play on a movie then put it away. Each set of 2 that I’ve used has only last 3 days each.So irritating!
Jaime M. Martinez,Overall Great Value,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall these batteries are a great value. I have purchased multiple packs of all battery sizes. I would give it 5 stars but unfortunately the last box of 36 i purchased had 3 completely dead/drained batteries right out of the box. This is the first time i had received any dead batteries.
David,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheapest I could find. Seem to last for a while in remote controls and mouse. Good value for money. Have bought Amazon Basic batteries for a few years now with no problems.
Summer L.,Absolute JUNK!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolute JUNK! I love Amazon, but the batteries I received can’t even power a tv remote for an hour!? I’m actually shocked by how ridiculously horrible they are. I didn’t expect them to be fantastic or as good as name brand batteries, but I did expect them to be able to power something, and for longer than two seconds. The might as well have saved their money and just sent me empty boxes, because all buying them did was leave me with that much more garbage to throw out. I was forced to give them one star, but I would really not give them any at all."
M,Great price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price for AAA batteries. Well packaged too -- they arrived in a protective cardboard box, which was a lot easier to open than standard plastic boxes."
trishadenise,Do not last!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries don't last long enough to mustify the effort to put them in the device. I purchased the Amazon brand AAA and AA in bulk, and every device we have used them in lasts a few days, if that, before needing to be replaced. Ridiculous!"
Kindle Customer jojo,Don't last very long.,2.0 out of 5 stars,I got these batteries for the LED candles in my lanterns on my patio and they last about 1/3 as long as any others I've used. I will not buy them again.
TinaR,Batteries that I constantly use and need,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these batteries for some Christmas decorations I bought that needed the size. Have bought these before, I like the fact that I can get a large package for a good price"
RJ,Decent battery with a good charge,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery for the money. I dont trust them for really expensive electronics but so far nothing has corroded or exploded so that is a plus.
Dyey,Good value,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good value battery best deal I could find. However I notice they dont last as long as other popular name brands. My mouse battery lasted only a month. But they work fine for the price.
Chris Tina,Landfill waste of money! Doesn’t last,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst batteries ever! They do not last. Run through them like they don’t have juice. I have volt meter and most of them when they arrived were not at full capacity. I have ordered this item 3x and it is the same each time. I will not be ordering them again.
cayla,As good if not better than the expensive ones,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these batteries! I’ve got both AA and AAA and will never buy batteries anywhere else. Such a good deal for a lot of batteries and work just as good if not better than the expensive batteries like energizer etc.
Troms,Not great.  Seem inconsistent.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"In my experience these are not great. They don’t seem to last very long, and they don’t seem to be consistent, battery to battery. They were really inexpensive."
Carolyn S. Striker,Batteries go dead within a year's time,2.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries were priced at a competitive price, but I am disappointed that now that it has been a year, the batteries I have not used yet show about 20% of their full potential, even though they have not been used and their expiration is 2025. I have never bought batteries that were almost dead within a year. So the price isn't as good when you can't use about 1/4 of the batteries."
Investigative Journalist,Batteries very hard to free,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The cardboard shipping pack may be easy open, but freeing batteries from their shrink wrap can require tools and serious patience. Not likely to reorder."
Nero,Great with flashlights,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these for my headlamp and mini lanterns and they work great. Don't know the point of the 'remote control' rating if I ain't use them for that but I guess they'll do good for that too.
Phil Glatz,"Excellent batteries, but packaging could use some improvement.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"As good as any of the big name brands. Only complaint is the very difficult to remove plastic from each group of four batteries. I appreciate that Amazon is concerned with reducing package size, but wrapping them in plastic isn't working for me. Would have been much better to use a small band to keep them together; since they are in a tight cardboard box, it is unlikely they will short each other out, the band probably isn't even needed."
Amazon Customer,Poor Battery Life,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are terrible! I have purchased these in the past and never had a problem, so maybe it’s just a bad batch. But they last maybe 24 hours before having to be replaced. Even in a TV remote- they don’t last long. Dollar store batteries have lasted longer than these. Very disappointed."
Sunny,Great buy!,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm only giving 4 stars because I haven't actually used any of these yet. But they are in three packages and make fun little thank you gifts. Like to my son in law who is always helping me with electronic problems. I will be buying more of these!
Kyle K.,They work,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are batteries and they work; however, I did find that my fire alarm truly did need energizer or duracell batteries. I figured a battery is a battery, but I was wrong. My alarm would go off randomly with these in it, but when I replaced it with energizer, everything was fine. Lesson learned. In all other cases they did the job."
Goviahuman,No brainer,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very solid batteries for the price. I’m at a point where I don’t think I’ve used any other brand of batteries for years. It’s pretty much a no brainer now.

Jessica,"Buyer beware, may not work",2.0 out of 5 stars,"They don't work for all things, ok for remote controls but not for children's toys. I would say don't but cheap batteries, but my Dollar Store batteries worked fine in the toys so I'd just say beware of buying Amazon Basic batteries."
Joseluis,Love the ergonomic feeling!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a design student so I do a bunch of computer work and during these past few weeks of my fall semester I was starting to develop some wrist pain. But being that projects do not stop in my field the pain got to a point where I had actually had to rest my wrist for three days straight which to me is like vacation. I ordered this mouse because of its promises. So far I haven't felt any pain after three days of use and I say three because it sort of has a ""feeling curve"" to it since your used to your arm being face down but damn I swear this vertical handling of the mouse feels tons better!"

SJMartin,Longest lasting batter ever purchased,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Keep it in perspective. It is a battery. However, how long they last and how reliable they are can be critical to you depending on what these are used in. emergency devices, radios etc. These will absolutely outlast most other batteries which you will pay far more for. This is a value for cost item and it works."
Bleu Patisserie Austin,Scientifically proven to be the best!,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son did a science project for 5th grade at school and tested batteries to see which were the ones that lasted the longest and these ones were the best. They also have the best value! Thanks!!!

Mike D,Great bang for the buck,5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK I was a little skeptical of buying Batteries from Amazon. Over the years I honestly never saw ANY competitive battery perform with the big two. After reading all the detailed reviews we decided to try them an with two little kids, we use a ton of batteries. These have impressed us with their performance. Undoubtedly a better bang for the buck than the leading brands, not to mention it is becoming increasingly harder to know that your buying genuine batteries here unless buying direct from the manufacturer like these."
The Amazing Shel,Really good batteries!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honestly you just can't beat this deal for the price and the pretty damn good quality of the batteries themselves. We have now purchased several types and they all seem to work really well and last just as long as the expensive guys.
Tavi Tracey,Buyers beware,1.0 out of 5 stars,Go this battery for some of my remote controls most of them are fire-stick so replace all the batteries And I’m wondering why my remote are not working to find out it was the batteries and there was no way to test them all.. It’s best to buy batteries in the store so you know the work.. don’t buy this product
Don Davison,Good Batteries for the Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far Amazon batteries are holding up well. There are better batteries but these are a better value based on price and performance.

Mikep,Lasts about two weeks,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used them for one of my remotes and after two weeks the remote is dead. I've changed them twice and same thing after about two weeks. I do not recommend these batteries.
Batman97045,Decent value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries seem to work fine. Packaging is a bit weird. I ended up taking them all out of the packaging they came in and put them in the empty box my old batteries came in.
Jhoffman,Great buy and value,5.0 out of 5 stars,We love these batteries! My son goes through batteries with his controllers and these seem to last a good amount of time. They always ship fast and are packaged great. Will continue to buy and recommend!

Ana G,Better than store batteries,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They arrived fast , but the only reason im giving 4 star is because the box broke down as soon as i try to open it and now i have all batteries everywhere in bag im a lil ocd so its a no for me , but so far toys been on and they haven't run out of battery thanks"
Lonely Planet,AAA pops up under AA!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted AA and under my search AAA came up and ordered the wrong size. Watch the item description! I kept them and ordered the AA.
Doctor Know,Batteries work as promised,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have compared these against other discount batteries and high dollar batteries. They are adequate and do the job but do not last as long as the high dollar batteries. You get what you pay for in batteries. They do the job well and no complaint but they just don't last as long as some. If you want to save money they work well. If you want high capacity and performance go ahead and spend a little more.
tharrison004,Amazon Batteries are great,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon Batteries work just as good as any Battery out there,and the price is great.I will be buying more of Amazon Batteries."
Jacob L.,Doesn't last long,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great price but wish I put it towards actual good batteries rather than to go for it for the price. I'd put it in a light in my class so I can show my kids that it wasn't time to talk - the light often died and I'd be replacing it weekly (easily) - the light would MAX be on an hour a day. So bummed about this product.
mel,Great value. As good or better than major brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value! Love these batteries and would reccomend to anyone. They work just as good as any major brand for a way better price
Jen Fisher,Don’t have a very long life,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are ok? For the money you can’t go wrong! They just don’t last very long. I used them in LED candles I have and seems like I’m constantly changing them, id still probably buy again."
Victor  Johnson,Incredibly short lifespan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the price when I first saw these online but couldnt be more disappointed when I discovered they really don't last. Whether in a remote control or any portable device they drain fast. Not sure if the initial charge is low or they just discharge sitting around. When you consider how short they last, the price is no bargain."
Amanda ,Happy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Repetive customer. So happy I have a quick and easy way to find dependable batteries at great prices. They last in our kids toys..remotes and other gadgets around the house.
T. ,Dollar store batteries last longer then these,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if I just got a bad batch but I found myself having to change out these batteries in the TV remote every 2 weeks. For the small led flashlights they would power for around 30 min and then no longer be good. Glad I had a lot of them because we kept having to replace them so quick.
Furry Friends Rescue,Half the pack leaked white powder,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good low price, but half the box of batteries leaked out white powder. Huh? Had to throw them out. Leaked white powder on many of my battery operated items. The other half worked fine."
Kelly Newsom,Money for my money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Needs AAA batteries and want extra, these were a better price than other name brands and I got more for my money. I’ve bought this brand before and they last just as long."
Utah-Treasures,they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are ...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
T,Good price and value.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The price is right for these. I just wonder that they don’t seem to last as long as a Duracell. Either way, would buy again."
Sandy,Extremely disappointing,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is the first Amazon branded product I have found to be inferior. The battery life seems to be nonexistent-I’m very disappointed

JDH,Reasonable price and long lasting.,5.0 out of 5 stars,I quit buying the name brand batteries because the AZ basics last just as long and are a better price for a larger quantity. I've bought every size they offer and I'm satisfied. Good product.
Kaitlyn T,Good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like that these were a very good price. I seen one of my friends post this as amazon was having a deal on them. They came just in time for the holidays. I didn’t have to hear we need batteries a million times.
IT Paul S,"Great batteries, great price, delivered to my door!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: A friend told me that many of the cheap batteries are 1.2 volts instead of the traditional 1.5 volts. These batteries are 1.5 volt batteries. Their shelf life seems to be shorter than some of the more expensive batteries. I will continue to buy these, just no more than I can use in a few months at a time.Most inexpensive batteries I've found anywhere, but just as long-lasting as anybody else's standard alkaline batteries. I'm going to order all of my batteries from Amazon from now on."
Patrick,Good Value,4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this pack 2 years ago. I still have a few batteries left. Will buy again when I am out. Great price.
LLMGTAB,Very short life,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have purchased many other amazon basic batteries and been pretty happy with them. These are my first AAA. I used them to replace batteries in a bluetooth scale. The no name batteries that came with the scale lasted a year. I have changed the amazon basic ones a second time already in just a month
Sharon K.,They’re aright.,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use them in my lights under the kitchen counter. I do have to recharge them every 10 days. Don’t know if that’s normal. They’re ok
harlequin reader,Life saving batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these batteriesGreat price and they last longer then the Duracell batteries I previously used.I use these batteries in my sons portable pulse oximeter which I use many times throughout the day and they last for quite a long time. I havent had to change them in over 2 months.

Teresa,Love these batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I haven't had any issues with the batteries that I order from Amazon. Love the package size. Having batteries on hand is a must for every household.

JC Griffith,Wish they lasted longer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was honestly hoping these would be great after having a couple products that came with them but they just died too quickly. I miss my Radioshack batteries, similar price but amazon has less life."
Mr. T. George,Do you like replacing batteries every other week?,1.0 out of 5 stars,"You should only buy these if you want to replace batteries every other week, which is extremely annoying. Will never buy again."
Richard Ruzinok,Don’t last long,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries don’t last at all! In my tv remote control, lasted 3 days?!"
Robert G.,similar to more expensive alkaline batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have now used a few of these and they seem to be typical of this type of battery as far as useful life goes. The price definitely makes them a good bargain. I can't speak for shelf life as I only purchased them about 6 months ago.
Kindle Customer,Leakers ...Bad deal,3.0 out of 5 stars,At least 3 batteries in a pack were leakers and dead. I find this unacceptable. I never before purchased a big pack with defective units and do not plan on doing this again . A hassle with returning stopped me from sending this back.
Murphy,Great batteries for an even better price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,We go through a lot of batteries in our office so being able to find some this cheap has really been a game changer for us.
dave,Big name battery performance for less.,5.0 out of 5 stars,These perform just like the big name brands and cost much less. Most discount batteries are krap but these are wonderful.
S,I searched for AA batteries and these came up in the #2 spot,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered AAA instead of AA's. The search should work correctly and not have this come up. Yes I should have noticed but I'm a bit angry.
Z,Donuts last longer on the shelf,3.0 out of 5 stars,Buying in bulk should have been good common sense but these batteries must loose their charge in my drawer because when I need a fresh one it's under powered and doesn't last long.
Kristin S Arnold,Not great! Don't last long!,1.0 out of 5 stars,I usually love theses batteries but this new batch is dying way to fast! Dollar store batteries are lasting longer then these. Not happy at all!

Michelle Boles,Long Use Batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We go through AAA batteries quickly as we use them for toys, tv remotes, etc. These last a fairly long time which is difficult to find for everyday use toys. Great quantity for the quality and dollar amount."
Amazon Customer,Batteries Store Charge Poorly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"At first this product was great, cheap and delivered great battery performance. However, after working my way through the box, I noticed that the shelf life of the batteries was deteriorating, yielding less and less time per battery in performance. Towards the end of the box, every other battery was so bad, I could put it brand-new straight into an Xbox controller, turn it on, and get the ""low battery"" notification. Would recommend for short-term use, but if you'll be using these over a period of, say, 6 months, I wouldn't recommend."
JCA,DANGEROUS,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost never right negative reviews, but...We are having the same leaky/explosive experience many others are having with these. Trying to use them in various light strands and flashlights during the CA power outages and they are proving more dangerous than the winds.But another brand."
Riccilynn ,Great price and product,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great price and I haven’t had any issue with the batteries I’m currently using dying. I originally bought them when the hurricane was coming for flashlights but have also used them for my cordless mouse and remote control! No issues at all!
Lauren,They're Batteries: They're Cheap and They Work. What Can I Say?,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like I said, they're cheap batteries that work just fine. I can't speak to longevity because I have them in a foreo face brush that I don't use every day. They seem totally fine and I'll definitely repurchase Amazon-branded batteries in the future."
Stlgrm,Inexpensive convenience,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have several flameless candles which require 3 AAA batteries each. I love the value this collection offers and they seem to provide usage as long as more expensive name brand batteries. Will definitely purchase again.
CraigB,Good batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased these batteries to use in my many remote control devices as well as some other shop equipment. So far they have lasted as long as the name brand batteries. In fact, I believe longer. Will continue to purchase these in the future."
Hunnie '59,Just as good as national brands,5.0 out of 5 stars,These work just as well and last just as long as the name brand battery for a fraction of the cost. I’ll never go back to name brand.
Judie,Poor quality and they don't work,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was replacing the 9 volt in my Pet training mat and I opened two brand new batteries I just received, I am furious that they appear smaller than the regular 9 volt I took out, and I don't know if the entire shipment is bad or what as I have not means of checking them. It will cost me a lot of inconvenience to return them to a location that takes back Amazon products! I would like a refund on this order as I am an excellent Amazon customer!"
mojojojo,Love the packaging,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work great just like other brands but my favorite part is their packaging in a neat stackable boxes, so I got a whole set of other sizes. No more flimsy annoying plastic packaging."
R35NissanGTR,The batteries are awesome!,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are awesome! They last a long time and now that Christmas is here I find some lights with batteries still in them from last year and was worried that they would be all corroded. Not with these batteries.

cmajor9th,Nearly dead on arrival,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After finding that these batteries purchased in August 2017 (Lot: 05-2027) were almost DOA when using them over the following year, I tossed the rest of the package.

J&J,AmazonBasics AAA,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good disposable AAA battery. its a good 2 to 1 replacement ratio from name brand. Meaning they usually only last 1/2 as long but when you do a cost break down unless you hit a good sale on name brand its still cheaper.
Amazon Customer,One pack of AAA Batteries in order were expired/stale.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"We love AmazonBasics products, order and use them often. However, this particular order of 2 cellophane packs of AAA Batteries, one pack was stale or expired because they would not power up the small device we put them in and actually were replacing existing AmazonBasics AAA's. The 2nd cellophane pack of AmazonBasics AAA's in that same box worked just fine, as expected and as usual."

Tommy M,All performance no guilt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work just as well as premium brands like Energizer, but they're a lot cheaper because you're not supporting a certain mascot's crippling coke habit.Seriously though; these are great quality and an awesome value."

Chris Kaczmarek,Hold up to name brands!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have found these batteries to hold up well to a Duracell and the value is much better. It’s great to just buy in bulk and have them.

Mccarthy,Great value.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They are as good as you can get value wise. They last slighty less than the top brands like Energizer....ect but if you have kids with lots of battery operated toys, this is it for you."
Philipp2,No need to pay top dollar for good batteries anymore.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously, I would only buy name brand batteries since I had a bad experience with some discount store branded batteries.however, after trying these, I will have to say that these performed every bit as good and half the price of the name brand. These are now my #1 go to battery now for AA and AAA batteries."
Jade W,Good Deal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this bulk box for use during a camping trip that involved around 8 or 9 lighting devices and three walkie talkies that took 3 batteries each. Four day trip and still got half the box left!
Elisa Tapia,Great for the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered these because they're much cheaper than I would get them in store. I've used the AA of the same type and brand before and had good experience with them so I hope these last as long. So far they've been working well and none have died yet, so I think they will last as long as the AA ones.I recommend these because the price is GREAT."

heather,Great value for techies!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a great value!

Lady Q,Great for all FireStick Products,5.0 out of 5 stars,I tried to put other AAA batteries into my FireStick and magically only these worked right away without any problems. I believe they last about a year in the remote. Haven't used them in anything else but the remote.
bill henry dillard,Will have to find a better quality battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,Went to finally use them as I order just before I run out and Amazon basic batteries have been great Till Now!!!

Mr Reno,Great value for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Some of the batteries don't Last longI would 85% of them last the normal time. I use them in everything that takes a triple A battery.But still a great value for the price.
Asmita g.,"compact packaging, doesn't last very long",3.0 out of 5 stars,"the packaging is really compact, which makes it easier for me to store these batteries, i have been using a couple of these for 2 months of so and didn't last long compare to other batteries I have used in past."
zachary W,longevity,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Buy children's walkie-talkies, children play all day ，battery and still have electricity, cheap, if there is a matching AAA battery together would be better"
Lauren,They work much better than one of their competitors.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had IKEA batteries previously, idk if I got a bad batch but they didn't even last a month in my remote. These however are still going strong. I think I'll buy these from now on."
Dynamo713,Great price and they are still going strong.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a lot of electronics that require AAA batteries (baby toys mostly and of course tv remotes) , so decided to save some money and went with this.It's been a few weeks and the batteries are still going, just imagine two 12 month babies playing with toys that make sounds and lights on and batteries are still holding the charge.Even if the batteries didn't last that long, there's plenty of them to swap them for the price you pay."
John,Just as good as name brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use these batteries in just about everything. They are a great value and are just as good if not better than the name brand alternatives.
0003-b,Buy any other brand,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Batteries do not last long in any device we have (amazon remote, flashlights, motion sense pantry light). Batteries are also prone to leak. We burned through the full box of 36 very quickly. Spend a little more and get Rayovac or leading brand. These are not a good value. Very very cheap batteries."
Josie,Good value,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. Very affordable. It's cheaper than dollar Shop. Kids have lots of toys and need lots of batteries. And it's very durable.

david marfisi,Not as good as name brand.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"As the old saying goes,you get what you pay for. Price is nice but they don't last like the everready or Duracell ones for a few dollars more.

I decided it was more cost effective to just get the Duracell batteries that last twice as long."
Timothy Wetherill,ÀZ batteries,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good decent quality batteries, fine for remotes, walkway lights etc without constant usage IE Gaming gear. Price is half of what is offered at both grocers and hardware stores in our area so go for it. I'll pen this a 5 star purchase after receiving both AA and AAA batteries while trying them out. . Nice packaging as well, easy open with no rollers in the drawer where I store them."
Paul Cohn,Value Value Value,5.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are just as good as the higher name brand. I always hate having to spend so much on batteries and am so glad that we can now purchase these amazon brands and not spend an arm and a leg

Jeff Y.,Good value for the money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They’re batteries y’all. If you are always going through batteries, buy these. You get a lot of them for a reasonable price and they last longer than batteries that you might find in some cheaper stores. Worth the buy. I started buying my batteries from Amazon and haven’t bought a battery anywhere else since."
Robert Sheppard,Why pay more,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap and seem to last about as long as most the others in the same class. The higher cost name-brand batteries don't justify the increase in cost. Great value.
Amazon Customer,Lost a customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT ORDER!!! Have been ordering these batteries for years however they’ve changed drastically. They last not even half the time now. DO NOT ORDER!!
Laura,Spend the extra to get a trusted battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,These batteries are pretty much garbage. I needed them for a label maker for my business.

Somebody,Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon ...,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.
smithy1965,Longevity is not there,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy the Amazon batteries. They do not last more than a month. You think it is a good price but you will go through them like crazy. Spend the extra and get a better quality product.
Arif Choudhry,20 batteries lasted for a couple of hours only.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased them for kids walkie talkie, each of them take 4 batteries. Each walkie talkie would give battery emplty sign in less than 30 minutes of kid's use i ended up using all 20 of them in couple of hours. May be it was walkie talkie taking too much of a power! i returned them as well"
L. Machak,exactly what you're hoping they'll be,5.0 out of 5 stars,I needed backup batteries in my work truck for multiple tools that take AAAs. They stay in the truck and have lasted a while and work great. I'm very happy with price and performance.

S. L. Peterson,Battery acid!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I thought I'd give these batteries a try, mostly in the headlamps I use for camping. The batteries showed up today with a leak in one. The cardboard box they were shipped in contained the leak, I'm happy to say.All things considered, I guess it was a lucky leak - that could have happened while out camping, and rumor on the street is that drizzled battery acid in the eyes can be difficult to treat in the wilderness.On the other hand, Amazon's return/refund feature was painless."
gina Fritsche,Good battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good battery for the money. Works for toys, remotes controllers etc. We have had no issues with them. They last!"
Brandon Korsen,"They work, they're cheap, and they're reliable.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used these batteries for quite a few camping trips where the battery life is important, and they stand up to the test of time on my end.

Miss Rose,Batteries test 100%,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Because of recent reviews on this item, I randomly tested a half dozen batteries in the 100-pack I ordered. Each was full to the very top of the meter, in contrast to the name brand batteries that I usually buy. I don't know if they leak or drain more quickly. All I know is that the ones I've tested were 100%."
Julio A. Martin,Good Value!,5.0 out of 5 stars,First thing I wanted to make sure is these were alkaline batteries once I saw they were it was all gravy from there got a good deal on these and they last pretty good for the price I paid.
Shani,Don’t buy these,1.0 out of 5 stars,These things suck. They don’t even last a week. I’ve replaced the batteries in my fire stick 3 times now and the remote will work for the first few days then it won’t. Won’t buy again and don’t recommend.

babyboomer,Good product from Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was tired of buying Duracell batteries only to have them start leaking and have to be thrown away even before I could use them at all. So far, these batteries have not leaked at all. I do believe that wrapping them as they are in just a few at a time has helped keep moisture from seeping into them. I have no complaints thus far with them."
SMCNY,No. Nope. Amazon should produce a better product!,2.0 out of 5 stars,Noooooo.Don't last long at all.For company as large as Amazon they should produce a BETTER BATTERY!

Matthew P,Equal to name brand competitors,5.0 out of 5 stars,Preform great at a much better price point.

Amanda,Same as Name Brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,We always buy Amazon batteries since they are the cheapest and last as long as normal name brand. Works for us!
Lindsay Maclay,WORST BATTERIES EVER,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These were, by far, the worst batteries I have EVER used. I literally have to change these batteries in my tv remote 3 TIMES A DAY because they die that quickly. DO NOT use these batteries in anything that protects your home, like a smoke detector, or alarm system because they will be dead within minutes of installing them."
Amazon Customer,Good deal.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A ton of batteries for a reasonable price. Not sure about longevity yet, but not an issue. I'll have backups for a long time."

D. Bergeron,"Hey wow, they are batteries.  But it’s 36 of them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just about every device has a remote control that take AAA or AA batteries. I go through 2 or 3 of these packages of these a year. The price makes changing batteries as needed less painful financially.
David,Batteries!!!!!!!!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,You get a battery and you get a battery and you get a battery!!!!I put it inside devices and they work. YEAH!
John Stokes,these batteries are cheap and plentiful and arrive quickly and you are spared any bewilderment at the store as to which batteries provide the best price to performance ratio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a box of batteries. It appears to be a law of nature that a person either has too many batteries or too few batteries. When this box arrived, I had quite a few batteries. I did not count them but yes, there were lots. If you need a lot of batteries, you can’t go wrong ordering this box. I haven’t rigorously tested these batteries, but I suspect they don’t quite last as long as other commercially available batteries because they are not as elaborately decorated. On the other hand, these batteries are cheap and plentiful and arrive quickly and you are spared any bewilderment at the store as to which batteries provide the best price to performance ratio."
R. Scaffidi,As good as the name brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been buying these for some time now and I don't see any difference with the name brands, except the cost."
Amanda,Great batteries great packaging.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Duracell move over. I bought these batteriea to replace all the remotes in my home they get some heavy use, after 4 months they still have barely drained.

L. Ramos,Professional Quality,5.0 out of 5 stars,I watch tons of videos of professionals working on toes and I wanted the clippers that they use. This is very high quality and doesn't disappoint. They are durable and sharp. Work slowly when using them and clean with rubbing alcohol. I would recommend these with no hesitation.
undertheboardwalk,They're really ok,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These batteries are very ok. They work well in remotes, but if placed in an RC car, or flashlight they die faster than Energizers."
See if you can git to that,Great quality and value,5.0 out of 5 stars,I used to buy bulk batteries from some other 'bargain' sites online when they were available.Had found myself in a jam and needed batteries and the other site didn't have them...took a chance with the AmazonBasics brand and am very happy with the price and quality.I certainly will buy all my batteries with AmazonBasics

Thelma 1206,great bargain,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Always a good deal. If they come wrapped in plastic, take the plastic off and let the battery acclimate for 30-60 seconds before using. I know this is supposed to only be for zinc batteries like hearing aids use. But I thought my new AAA batteries were dead after unwrapping them. After a while, they came to life. Go figure."

Wes Campbell,Really loving the Subscribe & Save on these.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"They've been great batteries so far, since my wife uses a TI-84 and goes through duracells like no one's business.

Richard Ramirez,Good batteries good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Something you don't think about, but these AAA batteries seem to go out right when you feel the worse and that remote will more work and the tv doesn't work without the exact remote and AAA batteries cost a good penny. If you get those dollar store ones they will be dead in a day. So just spend that now and stock them up."
KJC Muller,"Very disappointed, leaked & damage resulted.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I installed these in a (indoor) door alarm sensor, after 11 months one battery leaked and corroded the inside of the switch.

I have already used 2 pairs of this amazon basics AAA and on the 3rd pair now (within 1 month). Not worth to get it. I am feeling i should have gone for the duracell AAA instead

Amazon Customer,Its ok for cheap batteries,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a ""candle"" that runs on batteries and after a week of continuous use, they die and the batteries have to be replaced which isn't a good thing. I usually use Duracell batteries which would last be about 1-2 months for these candle lights."

Drew,Colossal Disappointment,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. What a colossal disappointment these turned out to be. I do not usually write reviews for products but after using these I really felt the need to come here and express the complete misrepresentation of these batteries that are being displayed on this page. I put two of these AAA batteries into my Roku remote on 11/20 and today is 12/7 and they are dead. They lasted a grand total of 17 days. Batteries that I put into remotes usually last for months at a time. Sometimes they last so long I think to myself, ""damn these are lasting a long time."" I have crummy no-name brand batteries in my regular TV remote right now, the ones that were originally included with the TV, and they are going on 4 years. If I bought Radioshack brand from Radioshack or Walmart brand (if they had one) from Walmart, then I would expect them to be cheap generic and would not expect much- but I actually expected quite a bit from Amazon. Amazon is supposed to be a respectable brand, they are, in fact, the largest retailer in the world. I expected them to be as good as Duracell or Energizer and you can think that that was silly or not silly but these things don't come within a mile of those brands, I would have been better off with those brands you see that copy the branding if Duracell and call themselves Durabell or whatever. Those last as long as these do. It's a damn shame too cause I liked the idea of getting all my future batteries from amazon."
Larry Kersten,Great value and lasts just as long as other more expensive ones.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value. I use these all the time. I have grandkids with lots of toys and these last just as good as any name brand batteries.
ItFitzwell,Frustrating individual cellophane 4-packs.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've always liked the Amazon AAA's and I get excellent performance out of them. But they recently went to a terrible packaging scheme where packs of 4 are sealed in some kind of cellophane that is quite frustrating trying to tear into with your thumb nail or teeth, you have to go get a pointy knife or scissors to break into the cellophane. Would it kill them to put a little pull tab on the packages like packs of gum have for the last 100 yrs?"

Vanessa R.,They work,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work. They’re not the best but for the price they’re ok. Don’t use in items that are constantly being used like Xbox controllers or remote control cars. They die quick. But they do work but they remind me of Rayovac or he dollar store batteries .

Lady51x50,Not good for things you use for extended periods,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had these awhile now. None have been bad and have not experienced any leaking.

Kristen Tapp,"Horrible, awful, and a complete waste of money",1.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the worst batteries I’ve ever had. About 1/2 of them don’t work at all and the other 1/2 work for a short amount of time. Not worth it, despite the price."
Richard G. Roberts,Meh,2.0 out of 5 stars,I don't believe that these last any longer in storage or in use than grocery store batteries
siri,I don't think they are the best quality.,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am finding that these batteries don't seem to have as much lasting power as the other batteries I have used. I have gone thru nearly all 36 of these in a 2-3 month time period and that is mostly from switching out alarm and remote batteries. I don't think they are the best quality.

Deborah Shore,Glad I switched to amazon batteries.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Although I've not been able to compare the longevity of these batteries compared to the ones I used to get, I am impressed. I've had no leaks, the thin cardboard box is easy to remove and less wasteful, and I LOVE that I can store them in a drawer in the simple plastic shrink wrap of the inner packaging. It can make them a little harder to dig out of a busy drawer, but it means they take up far less room in the drawer. Very convenient."
WhatsUP,Good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great price for batteries, I will continue to use Amazon Basics because the price is good.

I was able to scrape out the chemical spill and the device was put back in service. I don't know if it would have worked again if I hadn't acted quickly. To replace it would have cost about $100.

A battery lasted about 2 or 3 nights running 6 hrs a night, where the Energizer batteries have lasted almost 2 weeks and still working.

Urban mom,Beats buying at the store,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good price if you need to use several batteries at once. It costs lot less than going to the store. Multi pack was perfect for toys.

Amazon Customer,"Quick, quality, quantity. Happy customer here.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with AA size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them!

These came in quickly and are just what I needed

I bought these for remote control candles on my tree. I've had good luck with AA Amazon rechargeable batteries, but heard rechargeables are nasty to the environment so I went with these. Well, after they died as though they were magically programmed to(all within 24 hours), my husband kindly went to our local hardware store and bought some good batteries. I'm now stuck with these. I don't want to waste my own and others time and energy sending them back, but I have to share that they were an awful batch. That's all. NOW, having written that I've had good luck with the rechargeables, I'm remembering that I recharge them every week during the season. For all I know they might be less than good as well :) . I've also been unable to find contact information to let Amazon know about the batteries....Two Lessons for the New Year.....1. For things that are available, shop small and local.2. Don't waste time trying to find contact information for Amazon.3. Sometimes it's OK to leave less than flattering reviews for items. It might help someone.OK...that was three."

Still fully wrapped batteries barely carry a nominal charge after 12 months, nowhere near the 5 years or better promised per their “ special construction.” Tossing out since the remaining ones are useless, ordering a different brand. Live and learn. Trusted the amazon name enough to try them."

I bought several boxes and all were the same. I was told that I must have received a ""bad batch"". But, I bought several different batches. Amazon was very kind and refunded my money.

I say ""them"" because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on."

Y. M. Collins,"Good value, quick shipping",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Package of batteries came in Amazon shipping box measuring 13” x 9.75“ x 3 “. Inside that box with bubble wrap was a smaller cardboard box measuring 5.75” x 6.128” x .75”. The batteries came in two cellophane wraps, 20 batteries in all – 10 per wrapper.The AAA batteries measure 10.22mm in diameter and 44.22mm in length. Battery imprinted with Amazon basis. The battery is mostly silver accented with a green circle with a check mark inside. One of the ends of the battery has a little protruding button and is marked with a + sign. The other side of the battery is flat and marked with a minus sign. There are several descriptions and warnings printed on the battery. One of the messages with a black background states No mercury added with a note below that says Made in Indonesia with some more writing that looks like French. Also printed on the battery is a note reading ALKALINE BATTERY and below this, AAA/LR03/AM4 followed by 1.5V. There is some Chinese symbols as well. Another warning reads- May explode or leak if recharged, disposed of in fire, short circuited, or improperly inserted. Again this is followed with French writing. Also there are other warning labels, one with a small circle that has a line thru it, a small picture of a garbage can with a line thru it, and another small circle with arrows around a E.The battery fits in my small flashlight and powers up ok, but has not been in there long enough to test the longevity of the battery. Seems like a good value per battery if they last a while. I would purchase these again if they prove to last a reasonable time."
